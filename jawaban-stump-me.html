                                            The tunnel trees in Yosemite Valley are an amazing attraction to people who visit there. The tunnel trees are huge trees, giant redwoods, which have had tunnels carved in them, and cars can actually drive through some of the trees. The fact that the trees are large enough to have cars drive through them should give you some indication of just how big the trees are. There are currently two existing tunnel trees in Yosemite Valley. One of them is called the “Dead Giant.” This is just the stump, or bottom part, of a much larger tree. The hole was cut through the base of the tree in 1878, and stagecoaches used to drive through it. Today the Dead Giant still exists, but the stagecoaches do not. Passenger cars can and do drive through the 10-foot-wide opening in the tree stump. The other existing tunnel tree is the 230-foot high California Tree, which had a holecarved through it in 1895. This tree is no longer open to the public, so it is not possible to take a car through it. Unfortunately, a third tunnel tree no longer exists. The Wawona Tunnel Tree was a 2,100-year-old tree which was carved in 1881. A terrible snowstorm in 1969 caused this ancient giant of a tree to fall.Question:Which of the following is NOT true about the California Tree?a.Its tunnel is 230 feet high.b.Ꝋc.Its tunnel still exists.d.Cars are not allowed to go through it.e.Its tunnel was cut in 1895.​</a>

                                            C. Read the text and answer the questions. 
    As its name suggests, the stick insect resembles the 
twigs which it lives, providing it with one of the most
efficient natural camouflages on Earth. The animals and the
eqully inconspicuous leaf insect comprise the Phasmida
order, of which there are approximately 3,000 species.
    Stick insect species, often called walking sticks, range
in size from the tiny, 11.6-millimeter-long Timema cristinae 
of North America, to the formidable 328-millimeter-long
Phobaeticus kirbyi of Borneo. Tis giant measures over
55 centimeters with its legs outstretched, making it one of 
the world's logest insects. Fermales are normally larger than males.
     Phasmids generally mimic their surroundings in color, normally green or brown, although a few species are brilliantly colored and others conspicuously striped. Many stick insects normally have spectacularly beautiful wings, while others resemble little more than a stump. A number of species have spines and tubercels on their bodies.
     Found predominantly in the tropicks and subtropics-although several species live in temperate regions-stick insects thrive inforests and grasslands, where tey feed on leaves. Mainly nocturnal creatures, the spend much of their day motionless, hidden under plants.
      Many stick insects feign death to thwart predators, others will shed the occasional limb to escape an enemy's graps. A few swipe at predators with their spine-covered legs, while one North American species, Anisomorpha buprestoides, emits a putrid-smelling fluid. 
      Little is known about stick insects, makinng it difficult to declare the vulnerability of their status in the wild. The pet trade present a potential threat, along with the populer practice of framing their carcasses, like butterflies.

                                            The Legend of Rata's Waka by Hana Weka» NextLong ago Rata wandered sadly along the bank of the stream. He thought of his father who had died."I must bring him home," thought Rata, "but how am I going to do that?"He stared at the trees in the forest and said to himself, "I need a waka, a canoe that will be big enough to hold many warriors."He walked through the forest looking for a suitable tree. "Miro... rimu... kahikatea… Tawa tanekaha ... totora. Yes., totora it shall be."Early the next morning Rata returned to the forest and chopped down the totora tree. He left it where it fell and went home to rest. The next day, when he returned, the tree trunk was no longer lying on the ground. There were no chips of wood lying around nor any twigs or leaves. Rata stared at the trees around him and with a start, he recognised the totora tree that he had chopped down yesterday.The totora was growing tall and proud again as though it had never been touched. Rata was puzzled and a little fearful.He took up his axe and began to chop down the totora tree again. The chips flew into the air and after a while the totora fell to the ground once more. Rata trimmed the tree trunk. He stripped off the bark and when the night came he returned home.The next morning when he arrived to haul the log out of the forest Rata could not find it anywhere. All he found was the totora tree standing tall and silent.For the third Time Rata chopped the tree ~ He trimmed it. He shaped it. He began to scoop out the inside of the canoe from the trunk. When night fell, he left the half-formed canoe and returned home.Later that night, he took down his fighting spear.. crept out of his house and quietly stole back into the forest. As he approached he could hear strange singing and he could see light shining through the trees. He held his breath and crept closer.Then he stared in amazement.Birds were scurrying backwards and forwards, carrying leaves and twigs in their beaks, thousands of insects swarmed all over the log replacing chips and filling up the hollow. And as he watched, the half-formed canoe disappeared and was replaced with a smooth trunk that glowed red in the light. Then the birds scurried around the trunk pushing twigs, leaves and branches on to the rapidly forming tree.Branches that he had hacked and tossed away so carelessly were slowly dragged by hundreds of little creatures towards the fallen totora. Every piece of bark that Rata had flicked off with his axe was hunted for and taken back to the tree.All the while, the strange singing floated in the air above the forest. Rata could not bear to be hidden any longer. He stood up and stepped into the light. At once the singing stopped and the light went out. Rata was alone."Come back," he whispered. "Come back. I am sorry I cut down the totora tree. Please forgive me. I did not mean to harm it. I just wanted to build a canoe to go and fetch my father. My father is dead and I have to go and find him. Please come back. I can help you lift up the totora tree. I'll do anything you want to make up for what I have done."He began to lift the heavy tree and then all at once he felt it move, turn slowly, lift off the ground and then settle on the stump he had cut it from. Rata put his arms around the tree and said, "Please forgive me, totora, I did not think I was harming you when I cut you down."And as he held on to the tree, he felt thousands of little legs run over his body and on to the tree trunk. Rata shut his eyes for a moment and then very slowly bent down until he was able to pick up the little creatures and lift them into the tree.When the dawn came, Rata was alone. The totora tree was whole again. Every little creature had disappeared."I shall never cut down another tree again," said Rata"You may," said a voice close to him. "But you must ask Tane Mahuta, god of the forest and birds, for permission. He created all these trees and birds for Papatuanuku the Earth Mother. Ask him when you want to use any of it."Rata turned to see who was speaking. There was no one beside him. With a sigh, Rata turned to go home promising that he would not disturb the totora tree any more.His heart leapt when he saw a war canoe sitting on logs that stretched in an endless line through the forest."Mine?" he whispered."Yes," replied the voice."Rata's waka."Mark whether statements are true or false based on the story you have heard.Make correction to the false ones and write them in your booka. Rata wanted to bring his dead father back in a Wakab. He found a tamarind tree where he had cut the tree earlierc.

                                            The tunnel trees in Yosemite Valley are an amazing attraction to people who visit 
there. The tunnel trees are huge trees, giant redwoods, which have had tunnels carved 
in them, and cars can actually drive through some of the trees. The fact that the trees 
are large enough to have cars drive through them should give you some indication of 
just how big the trees are.
There are currently two existing tunnel trees in Yosemite Valley. One of them is 
called the “Dead Giant.” This is just the stump, or bottom part, of a much larger tree. 
The hole was cut through the base of the tree in 1878, and stagecoaches used to drive 
through it. Today the Dead Giant still exists, but the stagecoaches do not. Passenger cars 
can and do drive through the 10-foot-wide opening in the tree stump.
The other existing tunnel tree is the 230-foot high California Tree, which had a hole 
carved through it in 1895. This tree is no longer open to the public, so it is not possible 
to take a car through it.
Unfortunately, a third tunnel tree no longer exists. The Wawona Tunnel Tree was a 
2,100-year-old tree which was carved in 1881. A terrible snowstorm in 1969 caused this 
ancient giant of a tree to fall.

The Legend of Sangkuriang
A long time ago, the ancient land of Sunda was ruled by a king and a queen who had but a single daughter. Her name was Dayang Sumbi. She was beautiful and clever but also pampered and spoiled.
One day as she was weaving in her pavilion, she became moody and distracted, which caused her to keep dropping her shuttle on the floor. Once when it fell she exclaimed she would marry the one who gave it back to her. At that very moment her dog Tumang, a demigod possessing magic powers, came up to her with the shuttle in his mouth. Dayang Sumbi had to marry him.
They lived happily together, and Dayang Sumbi gave birth to a baby boy, human in appearance but endowed with his father's magic powers. She named him Sangkuriang. As the boy grew up, he was always guarded by the faithful dog Tumang, whom he knew only as a companion and not as his father, Sangkuriang became handsome and brave.
One day his mother asked him to go hunting with the dog and bring her venison for a feast. After hunting all day without success, Sangkuriang worried about facing his mother empty-handed. Desperate, he took an arrow and shot the dog. He returned home and handed over the meat to his pleased mother.
Soon after the feast, however, Dayang Sumbi questioned her son about the absence of Tumang. At first he evaded her queries but finally told her what had happened. She was horrified and struck her son so hard on the temple that he collapsed. For that, the old king banished his daughter from the court and she was made to roam around the kingdom. Sangkuriang recovered with a large scar on his temple, and he too left the court to wander about the world.
Years later, Sangkuriang met a beautiful woman and instantly fell in love with her. It was his own mother-they did not recognize each other. He pro¬posed to her and she agreed to marry him. On the day before the wedding, as she was caressing her fiancee's hair, Dayang Sumbi detected the scar on the temple. Horror struck her, for she was about to marry her own son, Sang¬kuriang. Without revealing the whole truth to him, she tried unsuccessfully to dissuade him. Desperate to avoid the marriage, she set conditions she thought impossible to meet: Sangkuriang had to make a lake that filled the whole val¬ley and build a boat for the couple to sail in, all before dawn. 
        Sangkuriang started to work. His love gave him extraordinary strength, and he used his magic powers to summon the spirits to help him. With boul¬ders and mud they dammed the river in the valley and the water rose and began to form a lake. In the early morning hours he chopped down a huge tree in the forest and began hollowing it out to make a boat. When Dayang Sumbi saw that he was about to accomplish what she had thought impossi¬ble, she called on the gods to bring the sun up early and thwart Sangkuriang.
The cock crowed, the sun rose much earlier than usual, and Sangkuriang realized he had been deceived. In a fit of fury he cursed Dayang Sumbi and kicked the half-finished boat back into the forest. There it lies upside down today, forming the mountain Tangkuban Perahu (Upturned Boat). Not far away is the stump of the tree Sangkuriang had felled, now called Bukit Tunggul. The dam Sangkuriang had built caused the valley to become a lake, where both Sangkuriang and
Dayang Sumbi drowned themselves. They were never heard of again.

                            5. The tunnel trees in Yosemite Valley are an amazing attraction to people who visit there. The tunnel trees are huge trees, giant redwoods, which have had tunnels carved in them, and cars can actually drive through some of the trees. The fact that the trees are large enough to have cars drive through them should give you some indication of just how big the trees are. There are currently two existing tunnel trees in Yosemite Valley. One of them is called the “Dead Giant.” This is just the stump, or bottom part, of a much larger tree. The hole was cut through the base of the tree in 1878, and stagecoaches used to drive through it. Today the Dead Giant still exists, but the stagecoaches do not. Passenger cars can and do drive through the 10-foot-wide opening in the tree stump. The other existing tunnel tree is the 230-foot high California Tree, which had a holecarved through it in 1895. This tree is no longer open to the public, so it is not possible to take a car through it. Unfortunately, a third tunnel tree no longer exists. The Wawona Tunnel Tree was a 2,100-year-old tree which was carved in 1881. A terrible snowstorm in 1969 caused this ancient giant of a tree to fall.Question:Which of the following is NOT true about the California Tree?a.Its tunnel is 230 feet high.b.Ꝋc.Its tunnel still exists.d.Cars are not allowed to go through it.e.Its tunnel was cut in 1895.​</h2><br />

                            6. C. Read the text and answer the questions. 
    As its name suggests, the stick insect resembles the 
twigs which it lives, providing it with one of the most
efficient natural camouflages on Earth. The animals and the
eqully inconspicuous leaf insect comprise the Phasmida
order, of which there are approximately 3,000 species.
    Stick insect species, often called walking sticks, range
in size from the tiny, 11.6-millimeter-long Timema cristinae 
of North America, to the formidable 328-millimeter-long
Phobaeticus kirbyi of Borneo. Tis giant measures over
55 centimeters with its legs outstretched, making it one of 
the world's logest insects. Fermales are normally larger than males.
     Phasmids generally mimic their surroundings in color, normally green or brown, although a few species are brilliantly colored and others conspicuously striped. Many stick insects normally have spectacularly beautiful wings, while others resemble little more than a stump. A number of species have spines and tubercels on their bodies.
     Found predominantly in the tropicks and subtropics-although several species live in temperate regions-stick insects thrive inforests and grasslands, where tey feed on leaves. Mainly nocturnal creatures, the spend much of their day motionless, hidden under plants.
      Many stick insects feign death to thwart predators, others will shed the occasional limb to escape an enemy's graps. A few swipe at predators with their spine-covered legs, while one North American species, Anisomorpha buprestoides, emits a putrid-smelling fluid. 
      Little is known about stick insects, makinng it difficult to declare the vulnerability of their status in the wild. The pet trade present a potential threat, along with the populer practice of framing their carcasses, like butterflies.

                            10. The Legend of Rata's Waka by Hana Weka» NextLong ago Rata wandered sadly along the bank of the stream. He thought of his father who had died."I must bring him home," thought Rata, "but how am I going to do that?"He stared at the trees in the forest and said to himself, "I need a waka, a canoe that will be big enough to hold many warriors."He walked through the forest looking for a suitable tree. "Miro... rimu... kahikatea… Tawa tanekaha ... totora. Yes., totora it shall be."Early the next morning Rata returned to the forest and chopped down the totora tree. He left it where it fell and went home to rest. The next day, when he returned, the tree trunk was no longer lying on the ground. There were no chips of wood lying around nor any twigs or leaves. Rata stared at the trees around him and with a start, he recognised the totora tree that he had chopped down yesterday.The totora was growing tall and proud again as though it had never been touched. Rata was puzzled and a little fearful.He took up his axe and began to chop down the totora tree again. The chips flew into the air and after a while the totora fell to the ground once more. Rata trimmed the tree trunk. He stripped off the bark and when the night came he returned home.The next morning when he arrived to haul the log out of the forest Rata could not find it anywhere. All he found was the totora tree standing tall and silent.For the third Time Rata chopped the tree ~ He trimmed it. He shaped it. He began to scoop out the inside of the canoe from the trunk. When night fell, he left the half-formed canoe and returned home.Later that night, he took down his fighting spear.. crept out of his house and quietly stole back into the forest. As he approached he could hear strange singing and he could see light shining through the trees. He held his breath and crept closer.Then he stared in amazement.Birds were scurrying backwards and forwards, carrying leaves and twigs in their beaks, thousands of insects swarmed all over the log replacing chips and filling up the hollow. And as he watched, the half-formed canoe disappeared and was replaced with a smooth trunk that glowed red in the light. Then the birds scurried around the trunk pushing twigs, leaves and branches on to the rapidly forming tree.Branches that he had hacked and tossed away so carelessly were slowly dragged by hundreds of little creatures towards the fallen totora. Every piece of bark that Rata had flicked off with his axe was hunted for and taken back to the tree.All the while, the strange singing floated in the air above the forest. Rata could not bear to be hidden any longer. He stood up and stepped into the light. At once the singing stopped and the light went out. Rata was alone."Come back," he whispered. "Come back. I am sorry I cut down the totora tree. Please forgive me. I did not mean to harm it. I just wanted to build a canoe to go and fetch my father. My father is dead and I have to go and find him. Please come back. I can help you lift up the totora tree. I'll do anything you want to make up for what I have done."He began to lift the heavy tree and then all at once he felt it move, turn slowly, lift off the ground and then settle on the stump he had cut it from. Rata put his arms around the tree and said, "Please forgive me, totora, I did not think I was harming you when I cut you down."And as he held on to the tree, he felt thousands of little legs run over his body and on to the tree trunk. Rata shut his eyes for a moment and then very slowly bent down until he was able to pick up the little creatures and lift them into the tree.When the dawn came, Rata was alone. The totora tree was whole again. Every little creature had disappeared."I shall never cut down another tree again," said Rata"You may," said a voice close to him. "But you must ask Tane Mahuta, god of the forest and birds, for permission. He created all these trees and birds for Papatuanuku the Earth Mother. Ask him when you want to use any of it."Rata turned to see who was speaking. There was no one beside him. With a sigh, Rata turned to go home promising that he would not disturb the totora tree any more.His heart leapt when he saw a war canoe sitting on logs that stretched in an endless line through the forest."Mine?" he whispered."Yes," replied the voice."Rata's waka."Mark whether statements are true or false based on the story you have heard.Make correction to the false ones and write them in your booka. Rata wanted to bring his dead father back in a Wakab. He found a tamarind tree where he had cut the tree earlierc.

                            12. The tunnel trees in Yosemite Valley are an amazing attraction to people who visit 
there. The tunnel trees are huge trees, giant redwoods, which have had tunnels carved 
in them, and cars can actually drive through some of the trees. The fact that the trees 
are large enough to have cars drive through them should give you some indication of 
just how big the trees are.
There are currently two existing tunnel trees in Yosemite Valley. One of them is 
called the “Dead Giant.” This is just the stump, or bottom part, of a much larger tree. 
The hole was cut through the base of the tree in 1878, and stagecoaches used to drive 
through it. Today the Dead Giant still exists, but the stagecoaches do not. Passenger cars 
can and do drive through the 10-foot-wide opening in the tree stump.
The other existing tunnel tree is the 230-foot high California Tree, which had a hole 
carved through it in 1895. This tree is no longer open to the public, so it is not possible 
to take a car through it.
Unfortunately, a third tunnel tree no longer exists. The Wawona Tunnel Tree was a 
2,100-year-old tree which was carved in 1881. A terrible snowstorm in 1969 caused this 
ancient giant of a tree to fall.

The animals and the equally inconspicuosus leaf insect comprise the Phasmida order, of which there are approximately 3,000 species.
     Stick insect species, often called walking sticks, range in size from the tiny, 11.6-millimeter-long Timema cristinae of North America, to the formidable 328-millimeter-long Phobaeticus kirbyi of Borneo. This Giant measures over 55 centimeters with its legs outstretched, malking it one of the world's longest insect. Females are normally larger than males.
    phasmids generally mimic their surroundings in color, normally green or brown, although a few species are brilliantly colored and others conspicuously striped. Many stick insects normally have spectaculaly beautiful wings, while others resemble little more than a stump. A number of species have spines and tubercles on their bodies.

                            15. 
The Legend of Sangkuriang
A long time ago, the ancient land of Sunda was ruled by a king and a queen who had but a single daughter. Her name was Dayang Sumbi. She was beautiful and clever but also pampered and spoiled.
One day as she was weaving in her pavilion, she became moody and distracted, which caused her to keep dropping her shuttle on the floor. Once when it fell she exclaimed she would marry the one who gave it back to her. At that very moment her dog Tumang, a demigod possessing magic powers, came up to her with the shuttle in his mouth. Dayang Sumbi had to marry him.
They lived happily together, and Dayang Sumbi gave birth to a baby boy, human in appearance but endowed with his father's magic powers. She named him Sangkuriang. As the boy grew up, he was always guarded by the faithful dog Tumang, whom he knew only as a companion and not as his father, Sangkuriang became handsome and brave.
One day his mother asked him to go hunting with the dog and bring her venison for a feast. After hunting all day without success, Sangkuriang worried about facing his mother empty-handed. Desperate, he took an arrow and shot the dog. He returned home and handed over the meat to his pleased mother.
Soon after the feast, however, Dayang Sumbi questioned her son about the absence of Tumang. At first he evaded her queries but finally told her what had happened. She was horrified and struck her son so hard on the temple that he collapsed. For that, the old king banished his daughter from the court and she was made to roam around the kingdom. Sangkuriang recovered with a large scar on his temple, and he too left the court to wander about the world.
Years later, Sangkuriang met a beautiful woman and instantly fell in love with her. It was his own mother-they did not recognize each other. He pro¬posed to her and she agreed to marry him. On the day before the wedding, as she was caressing her fiancee's hair, Dayang Sumbi detected the scar on the temple. Horror struck her, for she was about to marry her own son, Sang¬kuriang. Without revealing the whole truth to him, she tried unsuccessfully to dissuade him. Desperate to avoid the marriage, she set conditions she thought impossible to meet: Sangkuriang had to make a lake that filled the whole val¬ley and build a boat for the couple to sail in, all before dawn. 
        Sangkuriang started to work. His love gave him extraordinary strength, and he used his magic powers to summon the spirits to help him. With boul¬ders and mud they dammed the river in the valley and the water rose and began to form a lake. In the early morning hours he chopped down a huge tree in the forest and began hollowing it out to make a boat. When Dayang Sumbi saw that he was about to accomplish what she had thought impossi¬ble, she called on the gods to bring the sun up early and thwart Sangkuriang.
The cock crowed, the sun rose much earlier than usual, and Sangkuriang realized he had been deceived. In a fit of fury he cursed Dayang Sumbi and kicked the half-finished boat back into the forest. There it lies upside down today, forming the mountain Tangkuban Perahu (Upturned Boat). Not far away is the stump of the tree Sangkuriang had felled, now called Bukit Tunggul.
