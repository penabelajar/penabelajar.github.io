                                            Explanation Text about Flood
Flooding is a disaster which commonly happens in large and densely populated cities.
In Indonesia, the floods hit Jakarta very often and cause many victims. Then, do you know
the
process of how flood happens? Pay attention to the following explanation.
The process of natural flooding is preceded by rain which falls to the surface of the
earth. Then the rain water is absorbed by the ground surface and flows to the lower place.
Once that condition happens, evaporation and the water appear to the surface of the land.
Flooding can be disastrous for humans when floods happen in an area that people live
because the water carries along objects like houses, bridges, cars, furniture and even people.
On the other hand, the process of non natural flooding is usually caused by bad habits
of humans who do not care about the environment, such as littering that can make water flow
clogged. This makes the water deposited in landfills which gradually becomes more common.
When water reservoirs can no longer hold water discharge, the water then overflows out
theland and cause flooding.

Earthquake is one of the most destroying natural disasters. Unluckily it often happens in several regions. Recently a horrible earthquake has shaken West Sumatra. It has brought great damages. Why did it occur? Do you know how an earthquake happens?
Earthquakes are usually caused when rock underground suddenly breaks along a fault. This sudden release of energy causes the seismic waves. It make the ground shake. When two two plates of rock are rubbing against each other, they stick a little. They don't just slide smoothly. The rocks are still pushing against each other, but not moving. 
After a while, the rock plates break because of all the pressure that's built up. When the rocks break, the earthquake occurs.</a>

They knew that anything dangerous can happen to them at any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would remain united in any case of danger.Suddenly, they saw a large bear approaching them. One of the friends at once climbed a nearby tree. But the other one did not know how to climb. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless, pretending to be a dead man.The bear came near the man lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place. Because the bears do not touch the dead creatures.Now the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend on the ground, “Friend, what did the bear tell you into your ears?” The other friend replied, “The bear advised me not to believe a false friend.”buatlah 5 soal pilihan ganda dari teks tersebut dalam bahasa inggris..

fresh blood and parked himself on the roof of the cave to get same sleep. Pretty
soon all the other bats smelt the blood and began hassling him about where he
got it. He told them to piss of and let him get some sleep, but they persisted
until he finally gave in. “ OK, follow me “, he said and flew out of the cave
with hundreds of bats behind him. Down through a valley they went, across a
river and into huge forest. Finally he slowed down and all the other bats were
excitedly around him with their tongues hanging out for blood. “ Do you she
that large oak tree over there? “ he asked. “ YES,  YES, YES!!!!” the bats all screamed in a

Various other Native American tribes also lived on the Great Plains. The Sioux, a group of seven Native American tribes, are best known for the fiercely combative posture against encroaching White civilization in the 1800s. Although they are popularly referred to as Sioux, these Native American tribes did not call themselves Sioux; the name was given to them by an enemy tribe. The seven Sioux tribes called themselves by some variation of the word Dakota, which means "allies" in their language. Four tribes of the eastern Sioux community living in Minnesota were known by the name Dakota. The Nakota included two tribes that left the eastern woodlands and moved out onto the plains. The Teton Sioux, or Lakota, moved even farther west to the plains of the present-day states of North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming.

Flood
Flooding is a natural phenomenon that usually happens in a lot of areas drained by the river flow. In simple terms, it can be defined as the presence of flood water in a vast region that covers the area of the earth’s surface.
Flooding process itself occurs when the rains come and cause water sources such as rivers, seas, lakes, and ditches no longer able to accommodate the water drop. The barren land covered with trees without overflowing water will speed up the process of proficiency level, because the trees that should absorb the water have been used as a furniture material. When the water source is no longer able to accommodate, the water will overflow and flow into residential areas and have a big impact. Nowadays, flood is an annually happening in some big cities in Indonesia, especially Jakarta.

Earthquake
Earthquake is a natural process that often occurs around us. It can produce a big shock of waves that can destroy anything. The earthquake is also very difficult to be predicted. However, earthquake’s power can be measured using a tool called seismograph. There are two types of earthquakes that categorized by geological factors and the area where the earthquake occurred. Both of types are tectonic and volcanic.
Tectonic earthquakes are one of the most common earthquakes. This occurred when the earth’s crust rocks broken because geological force created by the movement of tectonic plates. This type of earthquakes can cause any damage or natural disaster. Its strong vibrations are capable to spread into other parts of the earth quickly.
The second is volcanic earthquakes. Volcanic earthquakes occur due to magma activity inside the volcano. If the magma activity is getting higher, it will cause an explosion and earthquake vibrations. Volcanic earthquakes can be felt just around the volcano.
Earthquakes can cause the damage, if the power produced is quite large. The damages include: the buildings, the ground, and even can cause a tsunami.</a>

                            6. Explanation Text about Flood
Flooding is a disaster which commonly happens in large and densely populated cities.
In Indonesia, the floods hit Jakarta very often and cause many victims. Then, do you know
the
process of how flood happens? Pay attention to the following explanation.
The process of natural flooding is preceded by rain which falls to the surface of the
earth. Then the rain water is absorbed by the ground surface and flows to the lower place.
Once that condition happens, evaporation and the water appear to the surface of the land.
Flooding can be disastrous for humans when floods happen in an area that people live
because the water carries along objects like houses, bridges, cars, furniture and even people.
On the other hand, the process of non natural flooding is usually caused by bad habits
of humans who do not care about the environment, such as littering that can make water flow
clogged. This makes the water deposited in landfills which gradually becomes more common.
When water reservoirs can no longer hold water discharge, the water then overflows out
theland and cause flooding.

Various other Native American tribes also lived on the Great Plains. The Sioux, a group of seven Native American tribes, are best known for the fiercely combative posture against encroaching White civilization in the 1800s. Although they are popularly referred to as Sioux, these Native American tribes did not call themselves Sioux; the name was given to them by an enemy tribe. The seven Sioux tribes called themselves by some variation of the word Dakota, which means "allies" in their language. Four tribes of the eastern Sioux community living in Minnesota were known by the name Dakota. The Nakota included two tribes that left the eastern woodlands and moved out onto the plains. The Teton Sioux, or Lakota, moved even farther west to the plains of the present-day states of North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming.

First, modern schools tend to applyfast transferring knowledge because the school needs to catch the target of curriculum. Every subject will tend to be given in demonstrative method. Consequently students need extra media cover the subject. Since there is a laptop on every students' desk, this method will help student to get better understanding.
Secondly, finding an appropriate laptop is not difficult as it was. Recently there is an online shop which provides comprehensive information. The best is that the shop has service of online shopping. The students just need to brows that online shop, decide which computer or laptop they need, then complete the transaction. After that the laptop will be delivered to the students' houses. That is really easy and save time and money.
From all of that, having mobile computer is absolutely useful for students who want to catch the best result for their study. Buying laptop online is advisable because it will cut the price. This online way is recommended since online shop also provide several laptop types. Students just need to decide which type they really need.</h2><br />

Earthquake
Earthquake is a natural process that often occurs around us. It can produce a big shock of waves that can destroy anything. The earthquake is also very difficult to be predicted. However, earthquake’s power can be measured using a tool called seismograph. There are two types of earthquakes that categorized by geological factors and the area where the earthquake occurred. Both of types are tectonic and volcanic.
Tectonic earthquakes are one of the most common earthquakes. This occurred when the earth’s crust rocks broken because geological force created by the movement of tectonic plates. This type of earthquakes can cause any damage or natural disaster. Its strong vibrations are capable to spread into other parts of the earth quickly.
The second is volcanic earthquakes. Volcanic earthquakes occur due to magma activity inside the volcano. If the magma activity is getting higher, it will cause an explosion and earthquake vibrations. Volcanic earthquakes can be felt just around the volcano.
Earthquakes can cause the damage, if the power produced is quite large. The damages include: the buildings, the ground, and even can cause a tsunami.</h2><br />
