                        Long ago in the land of Sundanese, West Java, there is a beautiful heavenly goddess. His name Dayang Sumbi. He lived in a shack in the woods with a faithful dog, Tumang.<br /><br />One day, while weaving the fabric, she lost one of the tools. Being
 tired looking everywhere, Dayang Sumbi said to himself, "Anyone who can
 find a lost and give it back to me, if he was a man, I would make a 
good husband and if she is a woman, I would make her sister "<br /><br />To the shock, Tumang find tools and return it to him. Inevitably, Dayang Sumbi must fulfill its own promise to marry Tumang,
 who had been a person who has been cursed by the evil witch into a dog.<br /><br />Incidentally Dayang Sumbi gave birth to a baby boy and named him Sangkuriang. Sangkuriang grow into healthy adolescents who like to hunt animals in the forest. Dayang Sumbi never told Sangkuriang that Tumang is his father.<br /><br />One day, Sangkuriang and Tumang hunting deer in the woods. Soon they met with wild boar. Sangkuriang wondered, "Why is not there a deer today? But I thought 
the boar will not make any different." Sangkuriang Tumang shouted, "Go 
and fight the wild boar. Kill for me!"<br /><br />Surprisingly, Tumang not kill the boar as the boar actually the mother Dayang Sumbi. Wild boar go safely. This makes Sangkuriang very angry, he kills Tumang. Then, he took the dog liver and give it to Dayang Sumbi.<br /><br />After eating the liver, Dayang Sumbi Sangkuriang asked, "By the way, where Tumang?<br />I have not seen him since you came back from hunting.

                        <p> </p><p></p> the legend of Tangkuban boat<p></p><p>  Once upon a time in the land of Pasundan, West Java, there was a beautiful heavenly goddess.  Her name is Dayang Sumbi.  He lives in a hut in the forest with his loyal dog, Tumang.</p><p></p><p>  One day, while weaving cloth, he lost one of his tools.  Tired of looking everywhere, Dayang Sumbi said to herself, “Whoever can find a lost tool and return it to me, if he is a man, I will make him a husband and if he is a woman, I will make him big.  sibling "</p><p></p><p>  To his surprise, Tumang found the tool and returned it to him.  Like it or not, Dayang Sumbi must fulfill her own promise to marry Tumang, who was once cursed by an evil witch into a dog.</p><p></p><p>  By chance Dayang Sumbi gave birth to a baby boy and named him Sangkuriang.  Sangkuriang grew into a healthy teenager who likes to hunt animals in the forest.  Dayang Sumbi never told Sangkuriang that Tumang was his father.</p><p></p><p>  One day, Sangkuriang and Tumang were hunting deer in the forest.  Soon they met a wild boar.  Sangkuriang wondered, "Why are there no deer today? But, I don't think wild boars will make any difference."  Sangkuriang shouted Tumang, "Go and fight the wild boar. Just kill it for me!"</p><p></p><p>  Surprisingly, Tumang did not kill the wild boar because the boar was Dayang Sumbi's mother.  The pig left safely.  This made Sangkuriang very angry, he killed Tumang.  Then, he took the heart of a dog and gave it to Dayang Sumbi.</p><p></p><p>  After eating the liver, Dayang Sumbi asked Sangkuriang, "By the way, where is Tumang? I haven't seen him since you came back from hunting."</p><p></p><p>  "Mother," answered Sangkuriang slowly.  "I killed Tumang for disobedience. The liver you ate was Tumang's liver."</p><p></p><p>  "You! You are a stupid child!"  Dayang Sumbi shouted while hitting the soup spoon on Sangkuriang's head so hard that his head bled.  "Get out of my face, you murderous bastard. How dare you kill your own father? You are a useless son!"</p><p></p><p>  With a bloody head, Sangkuriang ran into the forest and up the hill.  Years passed, Sangkuriang turned into a handsome and skilled hunter.  He had forgotten all the bitter past because he had lost his memory.  He even forgot his name.</p><p></p><p>  One day, Sangkuriang met a beautiful woman in the forest whom he loved.  That woman is Dayang Sumbi, who cannot grow old because she is a goddess.  Sangkuriang did not recognize his own mother, but Dayang Sumbi recognized Sangkuriang from the old scar on his head.</p><p></p><p>  Drunk in love, Sangkuriang proposed to her.  To avoid a forbidden marriage between mother and daughter, Dayang Sumbi asked him to make a lake and a boat in one night as a wedding gift for him.  With the help of supernatural beings from the forest, Sangkuriang built a lake and a boat.  Dayang Sumbi knew it and she tricked the jinn by lighting a fire so that it seemed as if the sun had risen.  Knowing this, Sangkuriang was so angry that he kicked the boat and the boat overturned.  It became the Tangkuban Perahu mountain in West Java.</p><p></p><p>  Intrinsic Analysis of the Legend of Tangkuban Perahu (Theme, Mandate, Setting, Plot and Characterization)&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p></p><p>  OTHER folktales Slave Beans Tangkuban Perahu The Legend of Parambanan The Legend of Timun Mas Lutung Kasarung The Legend of Lake Toba Pesut Mahakam Mouse Deer and Crocodile Situ Bagendit The Origin of the Bali Strait</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>maaf jika salah<br />
