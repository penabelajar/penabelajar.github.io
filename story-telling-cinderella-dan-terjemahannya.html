poor unhappy girl, there was nothing at all. Her stepmother has two 
daughters and they were very bossy. No rest and no comfort. She had to 
work hard all day. Only when evening came was she allowed to sit for a 
while by the fire, near the cinders. That’s why everybody called her 
Cinderella.</p>
<p>Cinderella used to spend long hours all 
alone talking to the cat. The cat always said, “Miaow“, which really 
meant, “Cheer up! You have something neither of your stepsisters has and
 that is beauty.” It was quite true. Cinderella, even dressed in old 
rags, was a lovely girl. While her stepsisters, no matter how splendid 
and elegant their clothes, were still clumsy, lumpy and ugly and always 
would be.</p>
<p>One day, beautiful new dresses arrived 
at the house. A ball was to be held at the palace and the stepsisters 
were getting ready to go. Cinderella didn’t even dare ask if she could 
go too. She knew very well what the answer would be: “You? You’re 
staying at home to wash the dishes, scrub the floors and turn down the 
beds for your stepsisters.” They will come home tired and very sleepy. 
Cinderella sighed, “Oh dear, I’m so unhappy!” and the cat murmured 
“Miaow.”</p>





<p>Suddenly something amazing happened. As 
Cinderella was sitting all alone, there was a burst of light and a fairy
 appeared. “Don’t be alarmed, Cinderella,” said the fairy. “I know you 
would love to go to the ball. And so you shall!” “How can I, dressed in 
rags?” Cinderella replied.</p>
<p>The fairy smiled. With a flick of her 
magic wand Cinderella found herself wearing the most beautiful dress she
 had ever seen. “Now for your coach,” said the fairy; “A real lady would
 never go to a ball on foot! Quick! Get me a pumpkin!” “Oh of course,” 
said Cinderella, rushing away. Then the fairy turned to the cat. “You, 
bring me seven mice, and, remember they must be alive!”</p>
<p>Cinderella soon returned with the 
pumpkin and the cat with seven mice he had caught in the cellar. With a 
flick of the magic wand the pumpkin turned into a sparkling coach and 
the mice became six white horses, while the seventh mouse turned into a 
coachman in a smart uniform and carrying a whip. Cinderella could hardly
 believe her eyes.</p>
<p>“You shall go to the ball Cinderella. 
But remember! You must leave at midnight. That is when my spell ends. 
Your coach will turn back into a pumpkin and the horses will become mice
 again. You will be dressed in rags and wearing clogs instead of these 
glass slippers! Do you understand?” Cinderella smiled and said, “Yes, I 
understand!”</p>
<p>Cinderella had a wonderful time at the 
ball until she heard the first stroke of midnight! She remembered what 
the fairy had said, and without a word of goodbye she slipped from the 
Prince’s arms and ran down the steps. As she ran she lost one of her 
slippers, but not for a moment did she dream of stopping to pick it up! 
If the last stroke of midnight were to sound… oh… what a disaster that 
would be! Out she fled and vanished into the night.</p>
<p>The Prince, who was now madly in love 
with her, picked up the slipper and said to his ministers, “Go and 
search everywhere for the girl whose foot this slipper fits. I will 
never be content until I find her!” So the ministers tried the slipper 
on the foot of every girl in the land until only Cinderella was left.</p>
<p>Suddenly the fairy appeared and waved 
her magic wand. In a flash, Cinderella appeared in a splendid dress, 
shining with youth and beauty. Her stepmother and stepsisters gaped at 
her in amazement, and the ministers said, “Come with us Cinderella! The 
Prince is waiting for you.“ So Cinderella married the Prince and lived 
happily ever.</p><p>Semoga membantu!!!<br /></p><br /><br />

                        <p>Jawaban:</p><p>Cinderella lives with her mother and two stepsisters</p><p> Once upon a time in a land far away, there lived a beautiful girl named Cinderella.</p><p> She lives with her two stepsisters and a stepmother.  They didn't like Cinderella at all.  Cinderella was always told to do many things.  Starting from cooking, washing, mopping, and all other household chores are done by Cinderella alone.</p><p> Because she continues to work, Cinderella can only be friends with rats hiding in her house.  The rats were afraid that the cat's pet stepmother would hunt them.</p><p> One day, a guard from the kingdom came to the village.  He announced that there would be a party to find a wife for the prince.  It made all the girls in the village feel good, including Cinderella.  However, the two stepsisters and stepmother did not like it when Cinderella joined the party.</p><p> When the night of the party arrived, the stepmother gave Cinderella a lot of work.  Of course, so that Cinderella didn't have time to come to the party.  However, Cinderella was determined, she would still come to the event.  All of his work was completed quickly.</p><p> “This is a royal event.  Are you going to wear your old clothes? "  sneered the stepmother.</p><p> Cinderella became sad.  What her stepmother said was true, she could not have come to the party with her old clothes on.  Finally, the two stepbrothers and stepmother left without Cinderella.  Cinderella could only cry sadly in the backyard.</p><p> Meanwhile, at the palace, a party is underway to find a future wife for the prince.  However, it seemed that none of the girls were able to attract the prince's attention.  Likewise with Cinderella's two stepsisters, they were unable to attract the prince.</p><p> The Prince's Party in the Palace</p><p> Cinderella was still crying behind the house. Suddenly ...</p><p> Clingg!  Olala, her tears turned into a fairy.</p><p> "Why are you sad, Cinderella?"  asked the fairy.</p><p> Cinderella explained everything.  Hearing Cinderella's explanation, the fairy became pity.  He also intends to help Cinderella.</p><p> "Take a pumpkin, and call your mouse friends," pleaded the fairy.</p><p> Without wasting time, Cinderella obeyed the fairy orders.  With her magic wand, the fairy turns the pumpkin into a very beautiful horse carriage.  As for the mice, they were turned into bodyguards.  Cinderella herself, was turned into a princess.  Really, Cinderella looks very beautiful.  She was wearing a very beautiful dress and glass slipper.</p><p> "Remember, Cinderella.  My magic only lasts until midnight.  So, before twelve o'clock at night you have to go home, "said the fairy when he let Cinderella go.</p><p> Cinderella nodded in understanding.  He immediately went to the prince's palace using his pump train.  Arriving at the palace, the prince saw Cinderella.</p><p> "What a beautiful girl," murmured the prince.</p><p> Prince walked closer to Cinderella.  Olala, he asked Cinderella to dance.  How happy Cinderella.  He also danced with the prince.</p><p> Imperceptibly, it was almost twelve in the evening.  It was twelve in the evening, the clock in the palace chimed loudly.  Cinderella immediately remembered the fairy message.  He also said goodbye to the prince.</p><p> Prince tries to prevent Cinderella.  But too late, Cinderella was already running fast to the pump train.  However, while running, Cinderella's glass slipper accidentally fell.  The prince picked up the glass slipper, and stared sadly at Cinderella's departure.</p><p> After the ball, the prince became gloomy.  He is sad because he can't find the girl he loves, who is none other than Cinderella.  Knowing the prince's sadness, the king made a contest.  Anyone whose foot size fits the glass slipper is the girl who is sought.</p><p> The prince, accompanied by his guards, came to the houses of residents who had girls.  But, of the many girls who try glass shoes, not one girl has the right foot size.  The prince almost gave up.</p><p> The prince entered the last house, namely Cinderella's house. Of course, Cinderella's stepmother and two siblings did not allow Cinderella to try on the glass slipper.  They gave Cinderella a lot of work behind the house.  That way, the prince didn't know that there was another girl in the house.</p><p> Cinderella's two stepsisters also tried the glass slipper, but it still didn't fit.</p><p> "Where else to look for that girl, Prince?"  asked the bodyguard.</p><p> "I don't know either.  Maybe we won't be able to find the girl, "replied the prince sadly.</p><p> Suddenly, there was a very melodious singing from behind Cinderella's house.  The prince was curious.  He looked for the origin of the voice.</p><p></p><br />

                        Cerita rakyat from West SumatraOnce upon a time, on the north coast of Sumatra lived a poor woman and his son. The boy was called Malin Kundang. They didn’t earn much as fishing was their only source of income. Malin Kundang grew up as a skillful young boy. He always helps his mother to earn some money. However, as they were only fisherman’s helper, they still lived in poverty. “Mother, what if I sail overseas?” asked Malin Kundang one day to his mother. Her mother didn’t agree but Malin Kundang had made up his mind. “Mother, if I stay here, I’ll always be a poor man. I want to be a successful person,” urged Malin kundang. His mother wiped her tears, “If you really want to go, I can’t stop you. I could only pray to God for you to gain success in life,” said his mother wisely. “But, promise me, you’ll come home.”In the next morning, Malin Kundang was ready to go. Three days ago, he met one of the successful ship’s crew. Malin was offered to join him. “Take a good care of yourself, son,” said Malin Kundang’s mother as she gave him some food supplies. “Yes, Mother,” Malin Kundang said. “You too have to take a good care of yourself. I’ll keep in touch with you,” he continued before kissing his mother’s hand. Before Malin stepped onto the ship, Malin’s mother hugged him tight as if she didn’t want to let him go.It had been three months since Malin Kundang left his mother. As his mother had predicted before, he hadn’t contacted her yet. Every morning, she stood on the pier. She wished to see the ship that brought Malin kundang home. Every day and night, she prayed to the God for her son’s safety. There was so much prayer that had been said due to her deep love for Malin Kundang. Even though it’s been a year she had not heard any news from Malin Kundang, she kept waiting and praying for him.After several years waiting without any news, Malin Kundang’s mother was suddenly surprised by the arrival of a big ship in the pier where she usually stood to wait for her son. When the ship finally pulled over, Malin Kundang’s mother saw a man who looked wealthy stepping down a ladder along with a beautiful woman. She could not be wrong. Her blurry eyes still easily recognized him. The man was Malin Kundang, her son.Malin Kundang’s mother quickly went to see her beloved son. “Malin, you’re back, son!” said Malin Kundang’s mother and without hesitation, she came running to hug Malin Kundang, “I miss you so much.” But, Malin Kundang didn’t show any respond. He was ashamed to admit his own mother in front of his beautiful wife. “You’re not my Mother. I don’t know you. My mother would never wear such ragged and ugly clothes,” said Malin Kundang as he release his mother embrace.Malin Kundang’s mother take a step back, “Malin…You don’t recognize me? I’m your mother!” she said sadly. Malin Kundang’s face was as cold as ice. “Guard, take this old women out of here,” Malin Kundang ordered his bodyguard. “Give her some money so she won’t disturb me again!” Malin Kundang’s mother cried as she was dragged by the bodyguard, ”Malin… my son. Why do you treat your own mother like this?”Malin Kundang ignored his mother and ordered the ship crews to set sail. Malin Kundang’s mother sat alone in the pier. Her heart was so hurt, she cried and cried. “Dear God, if he isn’t my son, please let him have a save journey. But if he is, I cursed him to become a stone,” she prayed to the God.In the quiet sea, suddenly the wind blew so hard and a thunderstorm came. Malin Kundang’s huge ship was wrecked. He was thrown by the wave out of his ship, and fell on a small island. Suddenly, his whole body turned into stone. He was punished for not admitting his own mother.The Lonely Landy
<br />
One day, there was a porcupine named Landy. He was lonely. No one wanted
 to play with him, because they were afraid of his spike.

<br />

“Dear Landy. We don’t want to play with you because your spikes are too 
sharp. We don’t want you to hurts us,” said Cici the rabbit one day.

<br />

“Cici is right, Landy. It is not because you’re bad or rude to us, no, 
Landy. Just because of your spikes. They will stab us if we close to 
you,” said Tito the rooster.

<br />

Landy felt lonely. Landy spent most of the time day dreaming at the 
river bank, “I would be happy if there were no spikes on my body.”

<br />

Suddenly, Kuku the turtle appeared from the river. He came to Landy and said, “Landy, what are you thinking of?”

<br />

“Oh, nothing,” Landy replied.

<br />

“Don’t lie to me, Landy! Who knows I can help you,” said Kuku wisely. 
Then he sat beside Landy. He wasn’t afraid of Landy’s spikes.

<br />

Shortly, Landy told his problem. Kuku nodded his head. He said, “Poor 
you. But it isn’t your fault. I know, your spikes are very useful and 
helpful for you. They will realize it someday. Trust me!”

<br />

“Thanks, Kuku. You are my best friend.”

<br />

One day, Koko the frog held his birthday party. He invited all his 
friends, including Landy. But he decided not to come. He didn’t want to 
mess up the party.

<br />

“I’ll come with you Landy. I’ll tell everyone that you’re harmless,” 
said Kuku. Finally Landy attended the party. Everyone enjoyed it.

<br />

Suddenly Tito screamed, “Help….help.…! The evil wolf is coming. Save 
yourself!” Then, everyone saved their lives, except Kuku and landy. Kuku
 pulled his head and his leg into his shell. And Landy rolled his body 
into a ball.

<br />

Unintentionally, the evil wolf touched Landy. Of course, the spike 
pricked him. He screamed, “Ouch!” Since his foot was bleeding, he didn’t
 chase Landy’s friends any longer. Then, he ran away.

<br />

“Horray….horray….! Long live Landy! He saved our lives,” said Cici and 
her friends. They thanked him from then on. Landy wasn’t lonely anymore.

<br />Terjemahan

<br />Suatu hari, ada seorang bernama landak Landy. Dia kesepian. Tidak ada 
yang ingin bermain dengannya, karena mereka takut lonjakan nya.

<br />

"Ya Landy. Kami tidak ingin bermain dengan Anda karena Anda terlalu paku
 tajam. Kami tidak ingin Anda menyakiti kita, "kata Cici kelinci satu 
hari.

<br />

"Cici benar, Landy. Ini bukan karena Anda buruk atau kasar kepada kami, 
tidak, Landy. Hanya karena paku Anda. Mereka akan menusuk kita jika kita
 dekat dengan Anda, "kata Tito ayam.

<br />

Landy merasa kesepian. Landy menghabiskan sebagian besar hari waktu 
bermimpi di tepi sungai, "Saya akan senang jika tidak ada paku di tubuh 
saya."

<br />

Tiba-tiba, Kuku kura-kura muncul dari sungai. Dia datang ke Landy dan berkata, "Landy, apa yang Anda pikirkan?"

<br />

"Oh, tidak," jawab Landy.

<br />

"Jangan berbohong padaku, Landy! Siapa tahu aku bisa membantumu, "kata 
Kuku bijak. Kemudian dia duduk di samping Landy. Dia tidak takut 
lonjakan Landy.

<br />

Tak lama, Landy mengatakan masalahnya. Kuku mengangguk kepalanya. Dia 
berkata, "Kasihan kamu. Tapi itu bukan salahmu. Aku tahu, paku Anda 
sangat berguna dan membantu bagi Anda. Mereka akan menyadari suatu hari 
nanti. Percayalah! "

<br />

"Terima kasih, Kuku. Anda adalah teman terbaik saya. "

<br />

Suatu hari, Koko katak mengadakan pesta ulang tahunnya. Dia mengundang 
semua teman-temannya, termasuk Landy. Tapi dia memutuskan untuk tidak 
datang. Dia tidak ingin mengacaukan pesta.

<br />

"Aku akan datang dengan Anda Landy. Aku akan memberitahu semua orang 
bahwa Anda tidak berbahaya, "kata Kuku. Akhirnya Landy menghadiri pesta.
 Semua orang menikmatinya.

<br />

Tiba-tiba Tito berteriak, "Bantuan .... membantu ....! Kejahatan 
serigala datang. Menyelamatkan diri! "Lalu, semua orang menyelamatkan 
hidup mereka, kecuali Kuku dan landy. Kuku menarik kepalanya dan kakinya
 ke dalam cangkangnya. Dan Landy digulung tubuhnya menjadi bola.

<br />

Secara tidak sengaja, serigala jahat menyentuh Landy. Tentu saja, 
lonjakan ditusuk dia. Dia berteriak, "Aduh!" Karena kakinya berdarah, 
dia tidak mengejar teman Landy lagi. Kemudian, dia lari.

<br />

"Horray .... Horray ....! Hidup Landy! Dia menyelamatkan hidup kita, 
"kata Cici dan teman-temannya. Mereka mengucapkan terima kasih dari saat
 itu. Landy tidak kesepian lagi.

                        Storytelling tentang Cinderella

Once upon a time there lived an unhappy young girl. Her mother was dead 
and her father had married a widow with two daughters. Her stepmother 
didn't like her one little bit. All her kind thoughts and loving touches
 were for her own daughters. Nothing was too good for them - dresses, 
shoes, delicious food, soft beds, and every home comfort. But, for the 
poor unhappy girl, there was nothing at all. No dresses, only her 
stepsisters’ hand-me-downs. No lovely dishes, nothing but scraps. No 
rest and no comfort. She had to work hard all day. Only when evening 
came was she allowed to sit for a while by the fire, near the cinders. 
That’s why everybody called her Cinderella.

<br />

Cinderella used to spend long hours all alone talking to the cat. The 
cat said, “Miaow“, which really meant, “Cheer up! You have something 
neither of your stepsisters has and that is beauty.” It was quite true. 
Cinderella, even dressed in old rags, was a lovely girl. While her 
stepsisters, no matter how splendid and elegant their clothes, were 
still clumsy, lumpy and ugly and always would be.

<br />

One day, beautiful new dresses arrived at the house. A ball was to be 
held at the palace and the stepsisters were getting ready to go. 
Cinderella didn't even dare ask if she could go too. She knew very well 
what the answer would be: “You? You're staying at home to wash the 
dishes, scrub the floors and turn down the beds for your stepsisters.” 
They will come home tired and very sleepy. Cinderella sighed, “Oh dear, 
I'm so unhappy!” and the cat murmured “Miaow.”

<br />

Suddenly something amazing happened. As Cinderella was sitting all 
alone, there was a burst of light and a fairy appeared. “Don't be 
alarmed, Cinderella,” said the fairy. “I know you would love to go to 
the ball. And so you shall!” “How can I, dressed in rags?” Cinderella 
replied. “The servants will turn me away!”

<br />

The fairy smiled. With a flick of her magic wand Cinderella found 
herself wearing the most beautiful dress she had ever seen. “Now for 
your coach,” said the fairy; "A real lady would never go to a ball on 
foot! Quick! Get me a pumpkin!” “Oh of course,” said Cinderella, rushing
 away. Then the fairy turned to the cat. “You, bring me seven mice, and,
 remember they must be alive!”

<br />

Cinderella soon returned with the pumpkin and the cat with seven mice he
 had caught in the cellar. With a flick of the magic wand the pumpkin 
turned into a sparkling coach and the mice became six white horses, 
while the seventh mouse turned into a coachman in a smart uniform and 
carrying a whip. Cinderella could hardly believe her eyes.

<br />

“You shall go to the ball Cinderella. But remember! You must leave at 
midnight. That is when my spell ends. Your coach will turn back into a 
pumpkin and the horses will become mice again. You will be dressed in 
rags and wearing clogs instead of these glass slippers! Do you 
understand?” Cinderella smiled and said, “Yes, I understand!”

<br />

Cinderella had a wonderful time at the ball until she heard the first 
stroke of midnight! She remembered what the fairy had said, and without a
 word of goodbye she slipped from the Prince’s arms and ran down the 
steps. As she ran she lost one of her slippers, but not for a moment did
 she dream of stopping to pick it up! If the last stroke of midnight 
were to sound... oh... what a disaster that would be! Out she fled and 
vanished into the night.

<br />

The Prince, who was now madly in love with her, picked up the slipper 
and said to his ministers, “Go and search everywhere for the girl whose 
foot this slipper fits. I will never be content until I find her!” So 
the ministers tried the slipper on the foot of every girl in the land 
until only Cinderella was left.

<br />

“That awful untidy girl simply cannot have been at the ball,” snapped 
the stepmother. “Tell the Prince he ought to marry one of my two 
daughters! Can't you see how ugly Cinderella is?”

<br />

But, to everyone’s amazement, the shoe fitted perfectly.

<br />

Suddenly the fairy appeared and waved her magic wand. In a flash, 
Cinderella appeared in a splendid dress, shining with youth and beauty. 
Her stepmother and stepsisters gaped at her in amazement, and the 
ministers said, “Come with us Cinderella! The Prince is waiting for 
you.“

<br />

So Cinderella married the Prince and lived happily ever. As for the cat, he just said “Miaow!” <br /><br /><br />

But not many people know about the legend of “Malin Kundang”.<br /><br />Ladies and gentleman<br />I would like to tell you about “Malin Kundang”. A long time ago, in a small village near the beach in West Sumatra, a woman and her son lived. They were Malin Kundang and her mother. Her mother was a single parent because Malin Kundang's father had passed away when he was a baby. Malin Kundang had to live hard with his mother<br /><br />“Mother, what if I sail overseas? if I stay here, I’ll always be a poor man. I want to be a successful person,” said Malin kundang to his mother.<br /><br />His mother wiped her tears, “If you really want to go, I can’t stop you.

                        Onion and Garlic (Bawang Merah dan Bawang Putih)<br /><br />In the ancient time, lived a little family. The family consists of father, mother, and a beautiful girl named Garlic. They are a harmonious and happy family despite his father worked as an ordinary merchant. One day, the happiness in this family was lost because the mother died. Garlic was very sad because she was very fond of her mother. Her father was also so sad because he loved his wife so much.<br /><br />After Garlic’s mother died, her house was visited frequently by a widow who had a daughter named Onion. The widow often came with Onion to the Garlic’s home by bringing food, helping to clean the house, and chatting with Garlic’s father. Finally, the father thinks that he should marry the widow and made the widow as a new mother for Garlic.<br /><br />He asked for consideration of the proposal to Garlic. After being allowed to get married by Garlic, then her father immediately carried out the marriage. They become a new family and lived in a house. At first, the mother and Onions behaved Garlic very well. However, the good behavior did not to be last long. Soon, the Onion and her mother began to show their bad attitude. Garlic was often scolded and given heavy works when the father went to trade. She had to do a lot of housework while the Onions just sit and did not work at all. However, the situation was never told by her to his father, so the Garlic continued to be treated badly by Onions and her mother.<br /><br />One day, his father was sick and passed away. Since then, Garlic was treated worse than before. Garlic almost never had a break every day. In the morning, she had to get up in order to prepare breakfast and the water for Onion and her mother. Later, she also gave eating to the livestock, washing clothes, and even watering the entire garden. Although she should do so many works, she always did it happily. She hoped, with such sincerity, her mother would love her sincerely someday.<br /><br />On the morning, Garlic went to the river to wash the clothes. She was so excited and washed vigorously. Because of getting too excited, she was not aware that there was a shirt that washed away. She realized that the shirt had been washed away when the flow carried it far enough. Later, she pursued but did not get the shirt. She felt hopeless and immediately went home.<br /><br />The shirt was her mother’s favorite. Of course, the mother was angry and told her to look for the shirt until she could found it. Garlic came back to the river and walked to the west to seek her mother’s favorite shirt. She walked along the river up to tens of kilometers. After that, Garlic suddenly saw someone who was bathing the buffalo in the river. She asked the man about the clothes were washed away. Later, she was informed that the shirt drifting and it was not far from where she was standing. At that moment, Garlic immediately ran down the river to find the shirt.<br /><br />It was getting dark and the Garlic found a home. Because of completely exhausted, she decided to take a break in the house. Apparently, it housed an old lady who had previously found the shirt. The old lady wanted to return the shirt to her, but she should accompany the old lady during a week. She agreed to stay with the lady for a week. Within a week, she made the old lady to be so happy because she was diligent and never complained even though felt so tired.<br /><br />After accompanying for a week, she was given a pumpkin as the gift. When opening it, she was very surprised because there were so much gold and gems. She immediately went home and told the happening to her mother and also Onion. However, the gold and jewels that she got immediately seized and she was forced to tell where the jewelry could be obtained. Garlic immediately said that she got it from an old lady who lived near the river.<br /><br />In the next day, Onion came to that house and stayed for a week like what Garlic did. However, because Onion was a lazy girl, the old lady gave a different pumpkin from Garlic. Onion did not care and Onion immediately went home to open the pumpkin with her mother. Apparently, the content was not gems or gold, but the venomous snake that bit of Onion and the mother. Both of them died because of their greed.<br /><br />After the happening, Garlic was living alone, but she was more calm and lived happily with its gold and gem<br /><br />
