Her stepmother and her sisters were invited to attend the party. However, they did not allow her to go to the party. She was ordered to sew the party dresses that would be worn by her mother and sisters. While, she did not have time to sew her dress. Her mother and her sisters went to a party and left Cinderella alone at home.<br /><br /> She felt very sad and cried. Between her tears, suddenly a fairy godmother appeared and said “do not cry, I can send you to the ball now!”, But she kept crying and looked so sad. She said, “I do not have a dress to wear in the ball”. The fairy godmother of course would not be worry and waved the wand to transform the Cinderella’s old clothes into the new dress which was very beautiful. Furthermore, that fairy godmother touched Cinderella’s foot with the ​​wand and suddenly Cinderella had beautiful glass slippers. Cinderella was shocked and said, “wow, thank you, but how I could go to the ball?”. Fairy godmother then went into the kitchen and saw four rats. She turned it into golden four horses and into a beautiful buggy. Before leaving home, the Fairy Godmother said “Cinderella, you have to go home at middle of the night, because this magic will works only until midnight!”<br /><br /> When Cinderella entered the palace, everyone was stunned by her beautiful face. In fact, no one recognized her because she was so different. Cinderella was so pretty with the dress and the glass slippers. A handsome prince also saw Cinderella and he fell in love. He met Cinderella and asked, “Do you want to dance?” And she said, “yes, I want to dance with you”. Prince and Cinderella danced during the night and she was so happy at that night. She forgot the fairy godmother warning that she should go home in the middle of the night. At the last moment, Cinderella remembered her promise to the fairy godmother and went home. “I must go!”, said her. She ran quickly and one of her glass slippers left but she did not come back to pick it up.<br /><br /> Cinderella arrived home a few minutes later. When she arrived, the clock struck in twelve. The horses and the buggy back into the previous shape and she did not wear the glass slippers and the beautiful dress anymore. After that, her stepmother and sisters came home and talked about the beautiful women who danced with the prince. They were very curious about the identity of the woman who suddenly appeared.<br /><br /> In the palace, Prince kept thinking about Cinderella and he fell in love. Prince wanted to find out the identity of the girl, but he even did not know her name. Prince has only found the glass slipper, and he said, “I will find her, and I will marry the woman whose foot fits into this glass slipper!”.<br /><br /> In the next day, the prince and his bodyguards went to all the existing home. They wanted to find a woman whose foot matched with the size of the shoe. Cinderella stepsisters also tried the glass slipper but their feet do not match. When Cinderella wanted to try, her stepmother prevented and forbidden her. However, the prince said, “let her trying!”. When Cinderella wore a glass slipper, she had a perfect leg for the shoe. The prince then recognized her and he was convinced that she was a woman who danced with him at the dance. He married Cinderella and they lived happily.<br />

                        Storytelling tentang Cinderella

Once upon a time there lived an unhappy young girl. Her mother was dead 
and her father had married a widow with two daughters. Her stepmother 
didn't like her one little bit. All her kind thoughts and loving touches
 were for her own daughters. Nothing was too good for them - dresses, 
shoes, delicious food, soft beds, and every home comfort. But, for the 
poor unhappy girl, there was nothing at all. No dresses, only her 
stepsisters’ hand-me-downs. No lovely dishes, nothing but scraps. No 
rest and no comfort. She had to work hard all day. Only when evening 
came was she allowed to sit for a while by the fire, near the cinders. 
That’s why everybody called her Cinderella.

<br />

Cinderella used to spend long hours all alone talking to the cat. The 
cat said, “Miaow“, which really meant, “Cheer up! You have something 
neither of your stepsisters has and that is beauty.” It was quite true. 
Cinderella, even dressed in old rags, was a lovely girl. While her 
stepsisters, no matter how splendid and elegant their clothes, were 
still clumsy, lumpy and ugly and always would be.

<br />

One day, beautiful new dresses arrived at the house. A ball was to be 
held at the palace and the stepsisters were getting ready to go. 
Cinderella didn't even dare ask if she could go too. She knew very well 
what the answer would be: “You? You're staying at home to wash the 
dishes, scrub the floors and turn down the beds for your stepsisters.” 
They will come home tired and very sleepy. Cinderella sighed, “Oh dear, 
I'm so unhappy!” and the cat murmured “Miaow.”

<br />

Suddenly something amazing happened. As Cinderella was sitting all 
alone, there was a burst of light and a fairy appeared. “Don't be 
alarmed, Cinderella,” said the fairy. “I know you would love to go to 
the ball. And so you shall!” “How can I, dressed in rags?” Cinderella 
replied. “The servants will turn me away!”

<br />

The fairy smiled. With a flick of her magic wand Cinderella found 
herself wearing the most beautiful dress she had ever seen. “Now for 
your coach,” said the fairy; "A real lady would never go to a ball on 
foot! Quick! Get me a pumpkin!” “Oh of course,” said Cinderella, rushing
 away. Then the fairy turned to the cat. “You, bring me seven mice, and,
 remember they must be alive!”

<br />

Cinderella soon returned with the pumpkin and the cat with seven mice he
 had caught in the cellar. With a flick of the magic wand the pumpkin 
turned into a sparkling coach and the mice became six white horses, 
while the seventh mouse turned into a coachman in a smart uniform and 
carrying a whip. Cinderella could hardly believe her eyes.

<br />

“You shall go to the ball Cinderella. But remember! You must leave at 
midnight. That is when my spell ends. Your coach will turn back into a 
pumpkin and the horses will become mice again. You will be dressed in 
rags and wearing clogs instead of these glass slippers! Do you 
understand?” Cinderella smiled and said, “Yes, I understand!”

<br />

Cinderella had a wonderful time at the ball until she heard the first 
stroke of midnight! She remembered what the fairy had said, and without a
 word of goodbye she slipped from the Prince’s arms and ran down the 
steps. As she ran she lost one of her slippers, but not for a moment did
 she dream of stopping to pick it up! If the last stroke of midnight 
were to sound... oh... what a disaster that would be! Out she fled and 
vanished into the night.

<br />

The Prince, who was now madly in love with her, picked up the slipper 
and said to his ministers, “Go and search everywhere for the girl whose 
foot this slipper fits. I will never be content until I find her!” So 
the ministers tried the slipper on the foot of every girl in the land 
until only Cinderella was left.

<br />

“That awful untidy girl simply cannot have been at the ball,” snapped 
the stepmother. “Tell the Prince he ought to marry one of my two 
daughters! Can't you see how ugly Cinderella is?”

<br />

But, to everyone’s amazement, the shoe fitted perfectly.

<br />

Suddenly the fairy appeared and waved her magic wand. In a flash, 
Cinderella appeared in a splendid dress, shining with youth and beauty. 
Her stepmother and stepsisters gaped at her in amazement, and the 
ministers said, “Come with us Cinderella! The Prince is waiting for 
you.“

<br />

So Cinderella married the Prince and lived happily ever. As for the cat, he just said “Miaow!” <br /><br /><br />

                        Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Cinderella. She lived with her step mother and two step sisters.<br />The step mother and sisters were conceited and bad tempered. They treated Cinderella very badly. Her step mother made Cinderella do the hardest works in the house; such as scrubbing the floor, cleaning the pot and pan and preparing the food for the family. The two step sisters, on the other hand, did not work about the house. Their mother gave them many handsome dresses to wear.<br />One day, the two step sister received an invitation to the ball that the king’s son was going to give at the palace. They were excited about this and spent so much time choosing the dresses they would wear. At last, the day of the ball came, and away went the sisters to it. Cinderella could not help crying after they had left.<br />“Why are crying, Cinderella?” a voice asked. She looked up and saw her fairy godmother standing beside her, “because I want so much to go to the ball” said Cinderella. “Well” said the godmother,”you’ve been such a cheerful, hardworking, uncomplaining girl that I am going to see that you do go to the ball”.<br />Magically, the fairy godmother changed a pumpkin into a fine coach and mice into a coachman and two footmen. Her godmother tapped Cinderella’s raged dress with her wand, and it became a beautiful ball gown. Then she gave her a pair of pretty glass slippers. “Now, Cinderella”, she said; “You must leave before midnight”. Then away she drove in her beautiful coach.<br />Cinderella was having a wonderfully good time. She danced again and again with the king’s son. Suddenly the clock began to strike twelve, she ran toward the door as quickly as she could. In her hurry, one of her glass slipper was left behind.<br />A few days later, the king’ son proclaimed that he would marry the girl whose feet fitted the glass slipper. Her step sisters tried on the slipper but it was too small for them, no matter how hard they squeezed their toes into it. In the end, the king’s page let Cinderella try on the slipper. She stuck out her foot and the page slipped the slipper on. It fitted perfectly.<br />Finally, she was driven to the palace. The king’s son was overjoyed to see her again. They were married and live happily ever after.<br /><br />Generic Structure of Narrative Text int the Story of Cinderella<br /><br /><br />Cinderella story performed on the stage, screened from broadwaycollection.com<br />As an example of narrative text about Cinderella, this post tries to give a complete tool to understand the definition and structure of narrative genre.
