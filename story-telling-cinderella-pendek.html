                            2. story telling cinderella singkat dalam bahasa inggris</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>CINDERELLA</strong><br /></p><p>Once upon a time there lived a girl 
called Cinderella. she was happy live with her father and mother. until 
her mother died dead and her father had married a widow with two 
daughters. Her stepmother didn’t like her one little bit. But, for the 
poor unhappy girl, there was nothing at all. Her stepmother has two 
daughters and they were very bossy. No rest and no comfort. She had to 
work hard all day. Only when evening came was she allowed to sit for a 
while by the fire, near the cinders. That’s why everybody called her 
Cinderella.</p>
<p>Cinderella used to spend long hours all 
alone talking to the cat. The cat always said, “Miaow“, which really 
meant, “Cheer up! You have something neither of your stepsisters has and
 that is beauty.” It was quite true. Cinderella, even dressed in old 
rags, was a lovely girl. While her stepsisters, no matter how splendid 
and elegant their clothes, were still clumsy, lumpy and ugly and always 
would be.</p>
<p>One day, beautiful new dresses arrived 
at the house. A ball was to be held at the palace and the stepsisters 
were getting ready to go. Cinderella didn’t even dare ask if she could 
go too. She knew very well what the answer would be: “You? You’re 
staying at home to wash the dishes, scrub the floors and turn down the 
beds for your stepsisters.” They will come home tired and very sleepy. 
Cinderella sighed, “Oh dear, I’m so unhappy!” and the cat murmured 
“Miaow.”</p>





<p>Suddenly something amazing happened. As 
Cinderella was sitting all alone, there was a burst of light and a fairy
 appeared. “Don’t be alarmed, Cinderella,” said the fairy. “I know you 
would love to go to the ball. And so you shall!” “How can I, dressed in 
rags?” Cinderella replied.</p>
<p>The fairy smiled. With a flick of her 
magic wand Cinderella found herself wearing the most beautiful dress she
 had ever seen. “Now for your coach,” said the fairy; “A real lady would
 never go to a ball on foot! Quick! Get me a pumpkin!” “Oh of course,” 
said Cinderella, rushing away. Then the fairy turned to the cat. “You, 
bring me seven mice, and, remember they must be alive!”</p>
<p>Cinderella soon returned with the 
pumpkin and the cat with seven mice he had caught in the cellar. With a 
flick of the magic wand the pumpkin turned into a sparkling coach and 
the mice became six white horses, while the seventh mouse turned into a 
coachman in a smart uniform and carrying a whip. Cinderella could hardly
 believe her eyes.</p>
<p>“You shall go to the ball Cinderella. 
But remember! You must leave at midnight. That is when my spell ends. 
Your coach will turn back into a pumpkin and the horses will become mice
 again. You will be dressed in rags and wearing clogs instead of these 
glass slippers! Do you understand?” Cinderella smiled and said, “Yes, I 
understand!”</p>
<p>Cinderella had a wonderful time at the 
ball until she heard the first stroke of midnight! She remembered what 
the fairy had said, and without a word of goodbye she slipped from the 
Prince’s arms and ran down the steps. As she ran she lost one of her 
slippers, but not for a moment did she dream of stopping to pick it up! 
If the last stroke of midnight were to sound… oh… what a disaster that 
would be! Out she fled and vanished into the night.</p>
<p>The Prince, who was now madly in love 
with her, picked up the slipper and said to his ministers, “Go and 
search everywhere for the girl whose foot this slipper fits. I will 
never be content until I find her!” So the ministers tried the slipper 
on the foot of every girl in the land until only Cinderella was left.</p>
<p>Suddenly the fairy appeared and waved 
her magic wand. In a flash, Cinderella appeared in a splendid dress, 
shining with youth and beauty. Her stepmother and stepsisters gaped at 
her in amazement, and the ministers said, “Come with us Cinderella! The 
Prince is waiting for you.“ So Cinderella married the Prince and lived 
happily ever.</p><p>Semoga membantu!!!<br /></p><br /><br />

                        <p>Jawaban:</p><p>Cinderella lives with her mother and two stepsisters</p><p> Once upon a time in a land far away, there lived a beautiful girl named Cinderella.</p><p> She lives with her two stepsisters and a stepmother.  They didn't like Cinderella at all.  Cinderella was always told to do many things.  Starting from cooking, washing, mopping, and all other household chores are done by Cinderella alone.</p><p> Because she continues to work, Cinderella can only be friends with rats hiding in her house.  The rats were afraid that the cat's pet stepmother would hunt them.</p><p> One day, a guard from the kingdom came to the village.  He announced that there would be a party to find a wife for the prince.  It made all the girls in the village feel good, including Cinderella.  However, the two stepsisters and stepmother did not like it when Cinderella joined the party.</p><p> When the night of the party arrived, the stepmother gave Cinderella a lot of work.  Of course, so that Cinderella didn't have time to come to the party.  However, Cinderella was determined, she would still come to the event.  All of his work was completed quickly.</p><p> “This is a royal event.  Are you going to wear your old clothes? "  sneered the stepmother.</p><p> Cinderella became sad.  What her stepmother said was true, she could not have come to the party with her old clothes on.  Finally, the two stepbrothers and stepmother left without Cinderella.  Cinderella could only cry sadly in the backyard.</p><p> Meanwhile, at the palace, a party is underway to find a future wife for the prince.  However, it seemed that none of the girls were able to attract the prince's attention.  Likewise with Cinderella's two stepsisters, they were unable to attract the prince.</p><p> The Prince's Party in the Palace</p><p> Cinderella was still crying behind the house. Suddenly ...</p><p> Clingg!  Olala, her tears turned into a fairy.</p><p> "Why are you sad, Cinderella?"  asked the fairy.</p><p> Cinderella explained everything.  Hearing Cinderella's explanation, the fairy became pity.  He also intends to help Cinderella.</p><p> "Take a pumpkin, and call your mouse friends," pleaded the fairy.</p><p> Without wasting time, Cinderella obeyed the fairy orders.  With her magic wand, the fairy turns the pumpkin into a very beautiful horse carriage.  As for the mice, they were turned into bodyguards.  Cinderella herself, was turned into a princess.  Really, Cinderella looks very beautiful.  She was wearing a very beautiful dress and glass slipper.</p><p> "Remember, Cinderella.  My magic only lasts until midnight.  So, before twelve o'clock at night you have to go home, "said the fairy when he let Cinderella go.</p><p> Cinderella nodded in understanding.  He immediately went to the prince's palace using his pump train.  Arriving at the palace, the prince saw Cinderella.</p><p> "What a beautiful girl," murmured the prince.</p><p> Prince walked closer to Cinderella.  Olala, he asked Cinderella to dance.  How happy Cinderella.  He also danced with the prince.</p><p> Imperceptibly, it was almost twelve in the evening.  It was twelve in the evening, the clock in the palace chimed loudly.  Cinderella immediately remembered the fairy message.  He also said goodbye to the prince.</p><p> Prince tries to prevent Cinderella.  But too late, Cinderella was already running fast to the pump train.  However, while running, Cinderella's glass slipper accidentally fell.  The prince picked up the glass slipper, and stared sadly at Cinderella's departure.</p><p> After the ball, the prince became gloomy.  He is sad because he can't find the girl he loves, who is none other than Cinderella.  Knowing the prince's sadness, the king made a contest.  Anyone whose foot size fits the glass slipper is the girl who is sought.</p><p> The prince, accompanied by his guards, came to the houses of residents who had girls.  But, of the many girls who try glass shoes, not one girl has the right foot size.  The prince almost gave up.</p><p> The prince entered the last house, namely Cinderella's house. Of course, Cinderella's stepmother and two siblings did not allow Cinderella to try on the glass slipper.  They gave Cinderella a lot of work behind the house.  That way, the prince didn't know that there was another girl in the house.</p><p> Cinderella's two stepsisters also tried the glass slipper, but it still didn't fit.</p><p> "Where else to look for that girl, Prince?"  asked the bodyguard.</p><p> "I don't know either.  Maybe we won't be able to find the girl, "replied the prince sadly.</p><p> Suddenly, there was a very melodious singing from behind Cinderella's house.  The prince was curious.  He looked for the origin of the voice.</p><p></p><br />

                        One fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went out to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool spring of water with a rose in the middle of it, she sat herself down to rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and catching it again as it fell.After a time she threw it up so high that she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled along on the ground, until at last it fell down into the spring. The princess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so deep that she could not see the bottom of it. She began to cry, and said, 'Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the world.'Whilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said, 'Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?''Alas!' said she, 'what can you do for me, you nasty frog?

Storytelling Pendek The Lonely Landy

One day, there was a porcupine named Landy. He was lonely. No one wanted
 to play with him, because they were afraid of his spike.

<br />

“Dear Landy. We don’t want to play with you because your spikes are too 
sharp. We don’t want you to hurts us,” said Cici the rabbit one day.

<br />

“Cici is right, Landy. It is not because you’re bad or rude to us, no, 
Landy. Just because of your spikes. They will stab us if we close to 
you,” said Tito the rooster.

<br />

Landy felt lonely. Landy spent most of the time day dreaming at the 
river bank, “I would be happy if there were no spikes on my body.”

<br />

Suddenly, Kuku the turtle appeared from the river. He came to Landy and said, “Landy, what are you thinking of?”

<br />

“Oh, nothing,” Landy replied.

<br />

“Don’t lie to me, Landy! Who knows I can help you,” said Kuku wisely. 
Then he sat beside Landy. He wasn’t afraid of Landy’s spikes.

<br />

Shortly, Landy told his problem. Kuku nodded his head. He said, “Poor 
you. But it isn’t your fault. I know, your spikes are very useful and 
helpful for you. They will realize it someday. Trust me!”

<br />

“Thanks, Kuku. You are my best friend.”

<br />

One day, Koko the frog held his birthday party. He invited all his 
friends, including Landy. But he decided not to come. He didn’t want to 
mess up the party.

<br />

“I’ll come with you Landy. I’ll tell everyone that you’re harmless,” 
said Kuku. Finally Landy attended the party. Everyone enjoyed it.

<br />

Suddenly Tito screamed, “Help….help.…! The evil wolf is coming. Save 
yourself!” Then, everyone saved their lives, except Kuku and landy. Kuku
 pulled his head and his leg into his shell. And Landy rolled his body 
into a ball.

<br />

Unintentionally, the evil wolf touched Landy. Of course, the spike 
pricked him. He screamed, “Ouch!” Since his foot was bleeding, he didn’t
 chase Landy’s friends any longer. Then, he ran away.

<br />

“Horray….horray….! Long live Landy! He saved our lives,” said Cici and 
her friends. They thanked him from then on. Landy wasn’t lonely anymore.<br /><br /><br />semoga membantu :)<br />

                        Storytelling tentang Cinderella

Once upon a time there lived an unhappy young girl. Her mother was dead 
and her father had married a widow with two daughters. Her stepmother 
didn't like her one little bit. All her kind thoughts and loving touches
 were for her own daughters. Nothing was too good for them - dresses, 
shoes, delicious food, soft beds, and every home comfort. But, for the 
poor unhappy girl, there was nothing at all. No dresses, only her 
stepsisters’ hand-me-downs. No lovely dishes, nothing but scraps. No 
rest and no comfort. She had to work hard all day. Only when evening 
came was she allowed to sit for a while by the fire, near the cinders. 
That’s why everybody called her Cinderella.

<br />

Cinderella used to spend long hours all alone talking to the cat. The 
cat said, “Miaow“, which really meant, “Cheer up! You have something 
neither of your stepsisters has and that is beauty.” It was quite true. 
Cinderella, even dressed in old rags, was a lovely girl. While her 
stepsisters, no matter how splendid and elegant their clothes, were 
still clumsy, lumpy and ugly and always would be.

<br />

One day, beautiful new dresses arrived at the house. A ball was to be 
held at the palace and the stepsisters were getting ready to go. 
Cinderella didn't even dare ask if she could go too. She knew very well 
what the answer would be: “You? You're staying at home to wash the 
dishes, scrub the floors and turn down the beds for your stepsisters.” 
They will come home tired and very sleepy. Cinderella sighed, “Oh dear, 
I'm so unhappy!” and the cat murmured “Miaow.”

<br />

Suddenly something amazing happened. As Cinderella was sitting all 
alone, there was a burst of light and a fairy appeared. “Don't be 
alarmed, Cinderella,” said the fairy. “I know you would love to go to 
the ball. And so you shall!” “How can I, dressed in rags?” Cinderella 
replied. “The servants will turn me away!”

<br />

The fairy smiled. With a flick of her magic wand Cinderella found 
herself wearing the most beautiful dress she had ever seen. “Now for 
your coach,” said the fairy; "A real lady would never go to a ball on 
foot! Quick! Get me a pumpkin!” “Oh of course,” said Cinderella, rushing
 away. Then the fairy turned to the cat. “You, bring me seven mice, and,
 remember they must be alive!”

<br />

Cinderella soon returned with the pumpkin and the cat with seven mice he
 had caught in the cellar. With a flick of the magic wand the pumpkin 
turned into a sparkling coach and the mice became six white horses, 
while the seventh mouse turned into a coachman in a smart uniform and 
carrying a whip. Cinderella could hardly believe her eyes.

<br />

“You shall go to the ball Cinderella. But remember! You must leave at 
midnight. That is when my spell ends. Your coach will turn back into a 
pumpkin and the horses will become mice again. You will be dressed in 
rags and wearing clogs instead of these glass slippers! Do you 
understand?” Cinderella smiled and said, “Yes, I understand!”

<br />

Cinderella had a wonderful time at the ball until she heard the first 
stroke of midnight! She remembered what the fairy had said, and without a
 word of goodbye she slipped from the Prince’s arms and ran down the 
steps. As she ran she lost one of her slippers, but not for a moment did
 she dream of stopping to pick it up! If the last stroke of midnight 
were to sound... oh... what a disaster that would be! Out she fled and 
vanished into the night.

<br />

The Prince, who was now madly in love with her, picked up the slipper 
and said to his ministers, “Go and search everywhere for the girl whose 
foot this slipper fits. I will never be content until I find her!” So 
the ministers tried the slipper on the foot of every girl in the land 
until only Cinderella was left.

<br />

“That awful untidy girl simply cannot have been at the ball,” snapped 
the stepmother. “Tell the Prince he ought to marry one of my two 
daughters! Can't you see how ugly Cinderella is?”

<br />

But, to everyone’s amazement, the shoe fitted perfectly.

<br />

Suddenly the fairy appeared and waved her magic wand. In a flash, 
Cinderella appeared in a splendid dress, shining with youth and beauty. 
Her stepmother and stepsisters gaped at her in amazement, and the 
ministers said, “Come with us Cinderella! The Prince is waiting for 
you.“

<br />

So Cinderella married the Prince and lived happily ever. As for the cat, he just said “Miaow!” <br /><br /><br />

                        The Lonely Landy.
One day, there was a porcupine named Landy. He was lonely. No one wanted to play with him, because they were afraid of his spike. “Dear Landy. We don’t want to play with you because your spikes are too sharp. We don’t want you to hurts us,” said Cici the rabbit one day. “Cici is right, Landy. It is not because you’re bad or rude to us, no, Landy. Just because of your spikes. They will stab us if we close to you,” said Tito the rooster. Landy felt lonely. Landy spent most of the time day dreaming at the river bank, “I would be happy if there were no spikes on my body.” Suddenly, Kuku the turtle appeared from the river. He came to Landy and said, “Landy, what are you thinking of?” “Oh, nothing,” Landy replied. “Don’t lie to me, Landy! Who knows I can help you,” said Kuku wisely. Then he sat beside Landy. He wasn’t afraid of Landy’s spikes. Shortly, Landy told his problem. Kuku nodded his head. He said, “Poor you. But it isn’t your fault. I know, your spikes are very useful and helpful for you. They will realize it someday. Trust me!” “Thanks, Kuku. You are my best friend. One day, Koko the frog held his birthday party. He invited all his friends, including Landy. But he decided not to come. He didn’t want to mess up the party. “I’ll come with you Landy. I’ll tell everyone that you’re harmless,” said Kuku. Finally Landy attended the party. Everyone enjoyed it. Suddenly Tito screamed, “Help….help.…! The evil wolf is coming. Save yourself!” Then, everyone saved their lives, except Kuku and landy. Kuku pulled his head and his leg into his shell. And Landy rolled his body into a ball. Unintentionally, the evil wolf touched Landy. Of course, the spike pricked him. He screamed, “Ouch!” Since his foot was bleeding, he didn’t chase Landy’s friends any longer. Then, he ran away. “Horray….horray….! Long live Landy! He saved our lives,” said Cici and her friends. They thanked him from then on. Landy wasn’t lonely anymore.<br />
