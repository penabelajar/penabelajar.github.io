Her stepmother didn’t like her one little bit. But, for the poor unhappy girl, there was nothing at all. Her stepmother has two daughters and they were very bossy. No rest and no comfort. She had to work hard all day. Only when evening came was she allowed to sit for a while by the fire, near the cinders. That’s why everybody called her Cinderella.<br /><br />Cinderella used to spend long hours all alone talking to the cat. The cat always said, “Miaow“, which really meant, “Cheer up! You have something neither of your stepsisters has and that is beauty.” It was quite true. Cinderella, even dressed in old rags, was a lovely girl. While her stepsisters, no matter how splendid and elegant their clothes, were still clumsy, lumpy and ugly and always would be.<br /><br />One day, beautiful new dresses arrived at the house. A ball was to be held at the palace and the stepsisters were getting ready to go. Cinderella didn’t even dare ask if she could go too. She knew very well what the answer would be: “You? You’re staying at home to wash the dishes, scrub the floors and turn down the beds for your stepsisters.” They will come home tired and very sleepy. Cinderella sighed, “Oh dear, I’m so unhappy!” and the cat murmured “Miaow.”<br /><br />Suddenly something amazing happened. As Cinderella was sitting all alone, there was a burst of light and a fairy appeared. “Don’t be alarmed, Cinderella,” said the fairy. “I know you would love to go to the ball. And so you shall!” “How can I, dressed in rags?” Cinderella replied.<br /><br />The fairy smiled. With a flick of her magic wand Cinderella found herself wearing the most beautiful dress she had ever seen. “Now for your coach,” said the fairy; “A real lady would never go to a ball on foot! Quick! Get me a pumpkin!” “Oh of course,” said Cinderella, rushing away. Then the fairy turned to the cat. “You, bring me seven mice, and, remember they must be alive!”<br /><br />Cinderella soon returned with the pumpkin and the cat with seven mice he had caught in the cellar. With a flick of the magic wand the pumpkin turned into a sparkling coach and the mice became six white horses, while the seventh mouse turned into a coachman in a smart uniform and carrying a whip. Cinderella could hardly believe her eyes.<br /><br />“You shall go to the ball Cinderella. But remember! You must leave at midnight. That is when my spell ends. Your coach will turn back into a pumpkin and the horses will become mice again. You will be dressed in rags and wearing clogs instead of these glass slippers! Do you understand?” Cinderella smiled and said, “Yes, I understand!”<br /><br />Cinderella had a wonderful time at the ball until she heard the first stroke of midnight! She remembered what the fairy had said, and without a word of goodbye she slipped from the Prince’s arms and ran down the steps. As she ran she lost one of her slippers, but not for a moment did she dream of stopping to pick it up! If the last stroke of midnight were to sound… oh… what a disaster that would be! Out she fled and vanished into the night.<br /><br />The Prince, who was now madly in love with her, picked up the slipper and said to his ministers, “Go and search everywhere for the girl whose foot this slipper fits. I will never be content until I find her!” So the ministers tried the slipper on the foot of every girl in the land until only Cinderella was left.<br /><br />Suddenly the fairy appeared and waved her magic wand. In a flash, Cinderella appeared in a splendid dress, shining with youth and beauty. Her stepmother and stepsisters gaped at her in amazement, and the ministers said, “Come with us Cinderella! The Prince is waiting for you.“ So Cinderella married the Prince and lived happily ever.<br /><br /><br />

Dia tinggal bersama dengan seorang ibu tiri yang jahat dan dua orang saudara tirinya. Mereka memperlakukan Cinderella dengan sangat buruk serta tidak menghargainya. Tidak jauh dari rumah Cinderella, terdapat sebuah istana raja yang begitu indah dan akan diselenggarakan sebuah pesta besar. Cinderella, ibu tiri, dan kedua saudarinya diundang untuk mengikuti pesta tersebut. Kendati demikian, Ibu Cinderella tidak mengizinkannya untuk pergi ke pesta tersebut. Dia diperintahkan untuk menjahit gaun pesta yang akan dipakai oleh ibu dan saudarinya. Sementara Cinderella tidak mempunyai waktu untuk menjahit gaun miliknya. Ibu dan saudari tiri Cinderella kemudian pergi ke pesta dan meninggalkan Cinderella sendirian di rumah.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Dia merasa sangat sedih dan terus menangis. Di sela-sela tangisannya, tiba tiba seorang ibu peri muncul dan berkata “jangan menangis, aku dapat mengirimmu ke pesta dansa sekarang juga!”, tetapi Cinderella terus menangis dan tampak begitu sedih. Ia berkata, “saya tidak mempunyai gaun untuk dipakai pada pesta dansa!”. Ibu peri tentu saja tidak khawatir, ia kemudian melambaikan tongkat sihirnya dan mengubah pakaian lama Cinderella menjadi gaun baru yang sangat indah. Selanjutnya, ibu peri menyentuh kaki Cinderella dengan tongkat sihirnya dan tiba-tiba ia mempunyai sepatu kaca yang indah. Cinderella terkejut dan berkata, “wow, terima kasih, tetapi bagaimana saya akan pergi ke pesta dansa?”. Ibu peri kemudian pergi ke dapur dan melihat empat ekor tikus. Ia mengubahnya menjadi empat ekor kuda berwarna emas dan sebuah kereta yang indah. Sebelum Cinderella meninggalkan rumah, ibu peri berkata “Cinderella, anda harus pulang tengah malam, karena sihir ini hanya berlangsung hingga tengah malam!”<br /><br /> <br /><br />Ketika Cinderella masuk ke dalam istana, semua orang terpana oleh wajahnya yang cantik. Bahkan, tidak ada yang mengenali dirinya karena ia begitu berbeda. Cinderella begitu cantik dengan gaun dan sepatu kaca. Seorang pangeran yang tampan juga melihat Cinderella dan ia jatuh cinta. Ia menemui Cinderella dan bertanya, “apakah anda ingin menari?” dan Cinderella berkata, “ya, aku ingin menari denganmu”. Pangeran dan Cinderella berdansa sepanjang malam dan Cinderella begitu senang malam itu. Dia lupa dengan peringatan ibu peri bahwa ia harus pulang pada waktu tengah malam. Pada saat terakhir, Cinderella teringat dengan janjinya dengan ibu peri dan segera pulang. “Aku haru pergi!” kata Cinderella ketika tengah malam. Ia berlari dengan cepat dan salah satu sepatu kaca miliknya terlepas namun ia tidak datang untuk mengambilnya.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Cinderella tiba dirumah beberapa menit kemudian. Ketika ia tiba, jam berdentang di angka dua belas. Kuda dan kereta miliknya kembali ke bentuk semula dan ia tidak lagi mengenakan sepatu kaca serta gaun yang indah. Tidak lama kemudian, ibu tiri dan saudari Cinderella datang serta membicarakan tentang wanita cantik yang berdansa dengan pangeran. Mereka teramat penasaran dengan identitas wanita yang tiba-tiba muncul tersebut.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Di istana, pengeran terus memikirkan Cinderella dan ia jatuh cinta. Pangeran ingin mencari tahu identitas gadis tersebut namun ia bahkan tidak mengetahui namanya. Pangeran telah menemukan sepatu kaca yang tertinggal dan ia berkata, “aku akan menemukan pemilik sepatu ini, wanita yang kakinya cocok dengan sepatu ini akan aku nikahi!”.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Keesokan harinya, pangeran dan pengawalnya pergi ke semua rumah yang ada wilayah pemerintahannya. Mereka ingin menemukan siapa wanita yang kakinya cocok dengan ukuran sepatu tersebut. Saudari tiri Cinderella juga mencoba sepatu kaca tersebut tetapi kaki mereka tidak cocok. Ketika Cinderella ingin mencoba, ibu tirinya mencegah dan melarangnya untuk mencoba. Kendati demikian, pangeran berkata, “biarkan ia mencobanya”. Ketika Cinderella memakai sepatu kaca, ia mempunyai kaki yang sempurna untuk sepatu tersebut. Pangeran kemudian mengenalinya dan ia yakin bahwa Cinderella adalah wanita yang berdansa dengannya di pesta dansa. Ia kemudian menikah dengan Cinderella dan mereka hidup bahagia.<br /><br /> <br /><br /><br />
