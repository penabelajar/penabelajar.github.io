                            2. story telling cinderella singkat dalam bahasa inggris</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>CINDERELLA</strong><br /></p><p>Once upon a time there lived a girl 
called Cinderella. she was happy live with her father and mother. until 
her mother died dead and her father had married a widow with two 
daughters. Her stepmother didn’t like her one little bit. But, for the 
poor unhappy girl, there was nothing at all. Her stepmother has two 
daughters and they were very bossy. No rest and no comfort. She had to 
work hard all day. Only when evening came was she allowed to sit for a 
while by the fire, near the cinders. That’s why everybody called her 
Cinderella.</p>
<p>Cinderella used to spend long hours all 
alone talking to the cat. The cat always said, “Miaow“, which really 
meant, “Cheer up! You have something neither of your stepsisters has and
 that is beauty.” It was quite true. Cinderella, even dressed in old 
rags, was a lovely girl. While her stepsisters, no matter how splendid 
and elegant their clothes, were still clumsy, lumpy and ugly and always 
would be.</p>
<p>One day, beautiful new dresses arrived 
at the house. A ball was to be held at the palace and the stepsisters 
were getting ready to go. Cinderella didn’t even dare ask if she could 
go too. She knew very well what the answer would be: “You? You’re 
staying at home to wash the dishes, scrub the floors and turn down the 
beds for your stepsisters.” They will come home tired and very sleepy. 
Cinderella sighed, “Oh dear, I’m so unhappy!” and the cat murmured 
“Miaow.”</p>





<p>Suddenly something amazing happened. As 
Cinderella was sitting all alone, there was a burst of light and a fairy
 appeared. “Don’t be alarmed, Cinderella,” said the fairy. “I know you 
would love to go to the ball. And so you shall!” “How can I, dressed in 
rags?” Cinderella replied.</p>
<p>The fairy smiled. With a flick of her 
magic wand Cinderella found herself wearing the most beautiful dress she
 had ever seen. “Now for your coach,” said the fairy; “A real lady would
 never go to a ball on foot! Quick! Get me a pumpkin!” “Oh of course,” 
said Cinderella, rushing away. Then the fairy turned to the cat. “You, 
bring me seven mice, and, remember they must be alive!”</p>
<p>Cinderella soon returned with the 
pumpkin and the cat with seven mice he had caught in the cellar. With a 
flick of the magic wand the pumpkin turned into a sparkling coach and 
the mice became six white horses, while the seventh mouse turned into a 
coachman in a smart uniform and carrying a whip. Cinderella could hardly
 believe her eyes.</p>
<p>“You shall go to the ball Cinderella. 
But remember! You must leave at midnight. That is when my spell ends. 
Your coach will turn back into a pumpkin and the horses will become mice
 again. You will be dressed in rags and wearing clogs instead of these 
glass slippers! Do you understand?” Cinderella smiled and said, “Yes, I 
understand!”</p>
<p>Cinderella had a wonderful time at the 
ball until she heard the first stroke of midnight! She remembered what 
the fairy had said, and without a word of goodbye she slipped from the 
Prince’s arms and ran down the steps. As she ran she lost one of her 
slippers, but not for a moment did she dream of stopping to pick it up! 
If the last stroke of midnight were to sound… oh… what a disaster that 
would be! Out she fled and vanished into the night.</p>
<p>The Prince, who was now madly in love 
with her, picked up the slipper and said to his ministers, “Go and 
search everywhere for the girl whose foot this slipper fits. I will 
never be content until I find her!” So the ministers tried the slipper 
on the foot of every girl in the land until only Cinderella was left.</p>
<p>Suddenly the fairy appeared and waved 
her magic wand. In a flash, Cinderella appeared in a splendid dress, 
shining with youth and beauty. Her stepmother and stepsisters gaped at 
her in amazement, and the ministers said, “Come with us Cinderella! The 
Prince is waiting for you.“ So Cinderella married the Prince and lived 
happily ever.</p><p>Semoga membantu!!!<br /></p><br /><br />

                        <p>Jawaban:</p><p>Cinderella lives with her mother and two stepsisters</p><p> Once upon a time in a land far away, there lived a beautiful girl named Cinderella.</p><p> She lives with her two stepsisters and a stepmother.  They didn't like Cinderella at all.  Cinderella was always told to do many things.  Starting from cooking, washing, mopping, and all other household chores are done by Cinderella alone.</p><p> Because she continues to work, Cinderella can only be friends with rats hiding in her house.  The rats were afraid that the cat's pet stepmother would hunt them.</p><p> One day, a guard from the kingdom came to the village.  He announced that there would be a party to find a wife for the prince.  It made all the girls in the village feel good, including Cinderella.  However, the two stepsisters and stepmother did not like it when Cinderella joined the party.</p><p> When the night of the party arrived, the stepmother gave Cinderella a lot of work.  Of course, so that Cinderella didn't have time to come to the party.  However, Cinderella was determined, she would still come to the event.  All of his work was completed quickly.</p><p> “This is a royal event.  Are you going to wear your old clothes? "  sneered the stepmother.</p><p> Cinderella became sad.  What her stepmother said was true, she could not have come to the party with her old clothes on.  Finally, the two stepbrothers and stepmother left without Cinderella.  Cinderella could only cry sadly in the backyard.</p><p> Meanwhile, at the palace, a party is underway to find a future wife for the prince.  However, it seemed that none of the girls were able to attract the prince's attention.  Likewise with Cinderella's two stepsisters, they were unable to attract the prince.</p><p> The Prince's Party in the Palace</p><p> Cinderella was still crying behind the house. Suddenly ...</p><p> Clingg!  Olala, her tears turned into a fairy.</p><p> "Why are you sad, Cinderella?"  asked the fairy.</p><p> Cinderella explained everything.  Hearing Cinderella's explanation, the fairy became pity.  He also intends to help Cinderella.</p><p> "Take a pumpkin, and call your mouse friends," pleaded the fairy.</p><p> Without wasting time, Cinderella obeyed the fairy orders.  With her magic wand, the fairy turns the pumpkin into a very beautiful horse carriage.  As for the mice, they were turned into bodyguards.  Cinderella herself, was turned into a princess.  Really, Cinderella looks very beautiful.  She was wearing a very beautiful dress and glass slipper.</p><p> "Remember, Cinderella.  My magic only lasts until midnight.  So, before twelve o'clock at night you have to go home, "said the fairy when he let Cinderella go.</p><p> Cinderella nodded in understanding.  He immediately went to the prince's palace using his pump train.  Arriving at the palace, the prince saw Cinderella.</p><p> "What a beautiful girl," murmured the prince.</p><p> Prince walked closer to Cinderella.  Olala, he asked Cinderella to dance.  How happy Cinderella.  He also danced with the prince.</p><p> Imperceptibly, it was almost twelve in the evening.  It was twelve in the evening, the clock in the palace chimed loudly.  Cinderella immediately remembered the fairy message.  He also said goodbye to the prince.</p><p> Prince tries to prevent Cinderella.  But too late, Cinderella was already running fast to the pump train.  However, while running, Cinderella's glass slipper accidentally fell.  The prince picked up the glass slipper, and stared sadly at Cinderella's departure.</p><p> After the ball, the prince became gloomy.  He is sad because he can't find the girl he loves, who is none other than Cinderella.  Knowing the prince's sadness, the king made a contest.  Anyone whose foot size fits the glass slipper is the girl who is sought.</p><p> The prince, accompanied by his guards, came to the houses of residents who had girls.  But, of the many girls who try glass shoes, not one girl has the right foot size.  The prince almost gave up.</p><p> The prince entered the last house, namely Cinderella's house. Of course, Cinderella's stepmother and two siblings did not allow Cinderella to try on the glass slipper.  They gave Cinderella a lot of work behind the house.  That way, the prince didn't know that there was another girl in the house.</p><p> Cinderella's two stepsisters also tried the glass slipper, but it still didn't fit.</p><p> "Where else to look for that girl, Prince?"  asked the bodyguard.</p><p> "I don't know either.  Maybe we won't be able to find the girl, "replied the prince sadly.</p><p> Suddenly, there was a very melodious singing from behind Cinderella's house.  The prince was curious.  He looked for the origin of the voice.</p><p></p><br />

                        Storytelling tentang Cinderella

Once upon a time there lived an unhappy young girl. Her mother was dead 
and her father had married a widow with two daughters. Her stepmother 
didn't like her one little bit. All her kind thoughts and loving touches
 were for her own daughters. Nothing was too good for them - dresses, 
shoes, delicious food, soft beds, and every home comfort. But, for the 
poor unhappy girl, there was nothing at all. No dresses, only her 
stepsisters’ hand-me-downs. No lovely dishes, nothing but scraps. No 
rest and no comfort. She had to work hard all day. Only when evening 
came was she allowed to sit for a while by the fire, near the cinders. 
That’s why everybody called her Cinderella.

<br />

Cinderella used to spend long hours all alone talking to the cat. The 
cat said, “Miaow“, which really meant, “Cheer up! You have something 
neither of your stepsisters has and that is beauty.” It was quite true. 
Cinderella, even dressed in old rags, was a lovely girl. While her 
stepsisters, no matter how splendid and elegant their clothes, were 
still clumsy, lumpy and ugly and always would be.

<br />

One day, beautiful new dresses arrived at the house. A ball was to be 
held at the palace and the stepsisters were getting ready to go. 
Cinderella didn't even dare ask if she could go too. She knew very well 
what the answer would be: “You? You're staying at home to wash the 
dishes, scrub the floors and turn down the beds for your stepsisters.” 
They will come home tired and very sleepy. Cinderella sighed, “Oh dear, 
I'm so unhappy!” and the cat murmured “Miaow.”

<br />

Suddenly something amazing happened. As Cinderella was sitting all 
alone, there was a burst of light and a fairy appeared. “Don't be 
alarmed, Cinderella,” said the fairy. “I know you would love to go to 
the ball. And so you shall!” “How can I, dressed in rags?” Cinderella 
replied. “The servants will turn me away!”

<br />

The fairy smiled. With a flick of her magic wand Cinderella found 
herself wearing the most beautiful dress she had ever seen. “Now for 
your coach,” said the fairy; "A real lady would never go to a ball on 
foot! Quick! Get me a pumpkin!” “Oh of course,” said Cinderella, rushing
 away. Then the fairy turned to the cat. “You, bring me seven mice, and,
 remember they must be alive!”

<br />

Cinderella soon returned with the pumpkin and the cat with seven mice he
 had caught in the cellar. With a flick of the magic wand the pumpkin 
turned into a sparkling coach and the mice became six white horses, 
while the seventh mouse turned into a coachman in a smart uniform and 
carrying a whip. Cinderella could hardly believe her eyes.

<br />

“You shall go to the ball Cinderella. But remember! You must leave at 
midnight. That is when my spell ends. Your coach will turn back into a 
pumpkin and the horses will become mice again. You will be dressed in 
rags and wearing clogs instead of these glass slippers! Do you 
understand?” Cinderella smiled and said, “Yes, I understand!”

<br />

Cinderella had a wonderful time at the ball until she heard the first 
stroke of midnight! She remembered what the fairy had said, and without a
 word of goodbye she slipped from the Prince’s arms and ran down the 
steps. As she ran she lost one of her slippers, but not for a moment did
 she dream of stopping to pick it up! If the last stroke of midnight 
were to sound... oh... what a disaster that would be! Out she fled and 
vanished into the night.

<br />

The Prince, who was now madly in love with her, picked up the slipper 
and said to his ministers, “Go and search everywhere for the girl whose 
foot this slipper fits. I will never be content until I find her!” So 
the ministers tried the slipper on the foot of every girl in the land 
until only Cinderella was left.

<br />

“That awful untidy girl simply cannot have been at the ball,” snapped 
the stepmother. “Tell the Prince he ought to marry one of my two 
daughters! Can't you see how ugly Cinderella is?”

<br />

But, to everyone’s amazement, the shoe fitted perfectly.

<br />

Suddenly the fairy appeared and waved her magic wand. In a flash, 
Cinderella appeared in a splendid dress, shining with youth and beauty. 
Her stepmother and stepsisters gaped at her in amazement, and the 
ministers said, “Come with us Cinderella! The Prince is waiting for 
you.“

<br />

So Cinderella married the Prince and lived happily ever. As for the cat, he just said “Miaow!” <br /><br /><br />

“ THE
BEEF AND THE CAT ”

I do hope you’ll be happy after listening to my story, because
getting the audience or listeners happy is the purpose of this story, isn’t it
?                                                  

Are you ready ?                                                                                                               

Ok listen to me carefully in order to be able to
catch the sound, expression, and others so you can enjoy this story.

Long
time ago in Aksehir, there lived a happy couple. They were Nasrudin Hoja and
his beloved wife. Nasrudin Hoja was a very funny, smart and famous in that
country, so everyone knew him very much. He liked going round his village. One
day, after he was going round, he brought 2 kilos of beef and when he came in
front of the door of his house, he knocked it.

Thok Thok Thok ! Honey I’m comming. Then his wife opened the door for him.

Kreeet,
the sound of the door. Oh dear what is in your hand?

2 kilos of beef, Nasrudin answered.

Please use this to make kabob tonight. We will have a big meal
this night, he said.

Yes, dear I will make nice kabob for you. Said
his Wife.

Thank you honey, said Nasrudin.

As I told
you that Nasrudin liked going round, didn’t he?

He wasn’t
too long at home. Then he asked his wife permission.

Honey, I want to go out again, keep the house, said
Nasrudin

Yes, dear be careful !

Then
Nasrudin went out. But do yuo know after that when Nasrudin was out? His wife
didn’t make kabob for him, but she cooked the meat for making lunch for her
self and her friends instead. Was it a right behavior ? of course no ! It was a
big mistake for her. I think sinned against his husband, Nasrudin.

Then hours
latter, Nasrudin returned and asked whether the kabob was ready.

Honey ! have you finished making kabob? Is it ready now ? I’m
impatient to have it soon,

He
asked his wife.

You know
what about his wife? Of course she was very-very confuse how to answer her
husband’s question, because she has cooked the meat for her lunch and ate it up
with her friend.

Mmm mmm I’m sorry dear, she replied. But the cat ate it all while I was doing chores.

Oh no problem ! said Nasrudin.

Then
Nasrudin grabbed the cat and put it on the scale . And he spoke him self.

This cat weighs 2
kilos,
he remarked. “So if this is the cat, then where is
the beef? An if this the beef, then where is the cat? Oh I’m so confuse about
it.

And finally he said, “where is the beef? Where is
the cat? Where is the beef? Where is the cat? Where is the beef? Where is the
cat?, Until he felt sleep.

Ok, I think it’s all
my story and finally, let me say “Assalamu’alaikum Wr.Wb

                        The Lonely Landy.
One day, there was a porcupine named Landy. He was lonely. No one wanted to play with him, because they were afraid of his spike. “Dear Landy. We don’t want to play with you because your spikes are too sharp. We don’t want you to hurts us,” said Cici the rabbit one day. “Cici is right, Landy. It is not because you’re bad or rude to us, no, Landy. Just because of your spikes. They will stab us if we close to you,” said Tito the rooster. Landy felt lonely. Landy spent most of the time day dreaming at the river bank, “I would be happy if there were no spikes on my body.” Suddenly, Kuku the turtle appeared from the river. He came to Landy and said, “Landy, what are you thinking of?” “Oh, nothing,” Landy replied. “Don’t lie to me, Landy! Who knows I can help you,” said Kuku wisely. Then he sat beside Landy. He wasn’t afraid of Landy’s spikes. Shortly, Landy told his problem. Kuku nodded his head. He said, “Poor you. But it isn’t your fault. I know, your spikes are very useful and helpful for you. They will realize it someday. Trust me!” “Thanks, Kuku. You are my best friend. One day, Koko the frog held his birthday party. He invited all his friends, including Landy. But he decided not to come. He didn’t want to mess up the party. “I’ll come with you Landy. I’ll tell everyone that you’re harmless,” said Kuku. Finally Landy attended the party. Everyone enjoyed it. Suddenly Tito screamed, “Help….help.…! The evil wolf is coming. Save yourself!” Then, everyone saved their lives, except Kuku and landy. Kuku pulled his head and his leg into his shell. And Landy rolled his body into a ball. Unintentionally, the evil wolf touched Landy. Of course, the spike pricked him. He screamed, “Ouch!” Since his foot was bleeding, he didn’t chase Landy’s friends any longer. Then, he ran away. “Horray….horray….! Long live Landy! He saved our lives,” said Cici and her friends. They thanked him from then on. Landy wasn’t lonely anymore.<br />

                        <p>Once upon a time in the country of Japan there lived two frogs, one of whom made his home in a ditch near the town of Osaka, on the sea coast, while the other dwelt in a clear little stream which ran through the city of Kioto. At such a great distance apart, they had never even heard of each other; but, funnily enough, the idea came into both their heads at once that they should like to see a little of the world, and the frog who lived at Kioto wanted to visit Osaka, and the frog who lived at Osaka wished to go to Kioto, where the great Mikado had his palace.</p><p>So one fine morning in the spring they both set out along the road that led from Kioto to Osaka, one from one end and the other from the other. The journey was more tiring than they expected, for they did not know much about travelling, and half way between the two towns there arose a mountain which had to be climbed. It took them a long time and a great many hops to reach the top, but there they were at last, and what was the surprise of each to see another frog before him! They looked at each other for a moment without speaking, and then fell into conversation, explaining the cause of their meeting so far from their homes. It was delightful to find that they both felt the same wish--to learn a little more of their native country--and as there was no sort of hurry they stretched themselves out in a cool, damp place, and agreed that they would have a good rest before they parted to go their ways.</p><p>'What a pity we are not bigger,' said the Osaka frog; 'for then we could see both towns from here, and tell if it is worth our while going on.'</p><p>'Oh, that is easily managed,' returned the Kioto frog. 'We have only got to stand up on our hind legs, and hold on to each other, and then we can each look at the town he is travelling to.'</p><p>This idea pleased the Osaka frog so much that he at once jumped up and put his front paws on the shoulders of his friend, who had risen also. There they both stood, stretching themselves as high as they could, and holding each other tightly, so that they might not fall down. The Kioto frog turned his nose towards Osaka, and the Osaka frog turned his nose towards Kioto; but the foolish things forgot that when they stood up their great eyes lay in the backs of their heads, and that though their noses might point to the places to which they wanted to go their eyes beheld the places from which they had come.</p><p>'Dear me!' cried the Osaka frog, 'Kioto is exactly like Osaka. It is certainly not worth such a long journey. I shall go home!'</p><p>'If I had had any idea that Osaka was only a copy of Kioto I should never have travelled all this way,' exclaimed the frog from Kioto, and as he spoke he took his hands from his friend's shoulders, and they both fell down on the grass. Then they took a polite farewell of each other, and set off for home again, and to the end of their lives they believed that Osaka and Kioto, which are as different to look at as two towns can be, were as like as two peas.</p>two men were walking along one summer day. soon it became too hot to continue and on seeing a large pain tree nearrby, they threw themselves on the ground to rest in its shade. gazing up into the branches one man said to the other, "what a useless tree! it does not have fruit or nuts that we can eat and we cannot een use its wood for camping." the tree rustled in reply, "don't be so ungrateful. i am being extremely useful to you at this very moment, shielding you from the hot sun. you call me a good-for-nothing!"<br />
