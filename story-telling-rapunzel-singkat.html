The Legend of Lake Toba

<br />

Once upon a time in North
Sumatra lived a young man named Toba. One day he go fishing in the lake. He
waited a long time and suddenly he got big and fresh a golden fish. Then Toba
went home. At home Toba was very surprised because the fish could talk. “Please don’t eat me.” Said golden fish. “Who are you? How can you talk?” said Toba surprised. “I’m a golden fish, please don’t eat me.” Said golden
fish. “Mmm, all right.” Said Toba.

The next day, Toba went
farmer in the field. Toba farmer from morning until noon. He was very hungry
and tired, so he went home. At home, Toba was very surprised because there was
a beautiful girl who was cooking. “Who are you? Why are
you in my house?” said toba surprised. “I’m
sorry, I was a golden fish and now I human form, I’m here to give you some
food, as a sign of my gratitude.” Said the beautiful girl.

Time the past Toba and
the beautiful girl married and had a baby named Samosir. When Samosir is seven
years old, he was very lazy, stubborn, and mischievous. One day “Samosir, please deliver this food to your father, mother was
busy.” Said mother. “No, Mom! I want to play!”
said Samosir snapped. “Hey Samosir! What wrong with
you? He’s your father! He was hungry.” Said mother angry. Because mother
angry Samosir forced to deliver this food.

On the way to the farm
Samosir eat father lunch little by litte until the remaining few. When Toba
opened the eat box turn out it was empty, Toba was very angry to Samosir. “Whaat? Where the food?!” said Toba very angry. “I’m sorry, Dad. I’m so hungry.” Sampsir answered with
anxiety.

Toba felt really upset
with his son. And, suddenly he said something rude that was forbidden. “Your manner is like a little animal. It’s because your mother
is a fish. So you are like her. Go away from here!” Toba didn’t realize
that what he said was so rude. He was forbidden to tell about Samosir mother’s
origin.

Samosir sad and tell all
to his mother. “Calm down, Samosir. Don’t cry anymore.
Now, all you have to do is climbed the highest tree and stayed there. There
will be a huge flood and this village will be sink and disappear.” Said
mother.

Samosir went away and
climbed the highest tree in the village. Mother was really sad. She decided to
do suicide by jump to the lake. Suddenly, the sky was getting dark. Not so long
after that, the rain fall down. It was a great rain. The thunder and lightning
were so scary. Meanwhile, Toba was surprised by this disaster. He can not save
himself. And Samosir, although he climbed the highest tree, he still can not
escape the great disaster.

And then a small island
in the middle of the lake called Samosir Island. And the village was submerged
and became a large lake. The large lake is named TOBA.

                        The Rabbit and The Turtle

<br />

One day a
rabbit was boasting about how fast he could run. He was laughing at the turtle
for being so slow. Much to the rabbit’s surprise, the turtle challenged him to
a race. The rabbit thought this was a good joke and accepted the challenge. The
fox was to be the umpire of the race. As the race began, the rabbit raced way
ahead of the turtle, just like everyone thought. The rabbit got to the halfway
point and could not see the turtle anywhere. He was hot and tired and decided
to stop and take a short nap. Even if the turtle passed him, he would be able
to race to the finish line ahead of him. All this time the turtle kept walking
step by step by step. He never quit no matter how hot or tired he got. He just
kept going.

<br />

However, the
rabbit slept longer than he had thought and woke up. He could not see the
turtle anywhere! He went at full-speed to the finish line but found the turtle
there waiting for him.

                        One day, there was a beautiful girl named Cinderella. She lived with her wicked stepmother and two stepsisters. They treated Cinderella very badly. One day, they were invited for a grand ball in the king’s palace. But Cinderella’s stepmother would not let her go. Cinderella was made to sew new party gowns for her stepmother and stepsisters, and curl their hair. They then went to the ball, leaving Cinderella alone at home. . . <br /><br />Cinderella felt very sad and began to cries. Suddenly a fairy godmother appeared and said, “Don’t cry, Cinderella! I'll send you to the ball!” But Cinderella was sad. She said, “I don’t have a gown to wear for the ball!” The fairy godmother waved her magic wand and changed Cinderella’s old clothes into a beautiful new gown! The fairy godmother then touched Cinderella’s feet with the magic wand. And lo! She had beautiful glass slippers! “How will I go to the grand ball?” asked Cinderella. The fairy godmother found six mice playing near a pumpkin, in the kitchen. She touched them with her magic wand and the mice became four shiny black horses and two coachmen and the pumpkin turned into a golden coach. Cinderella was overjoyed and set off for the ball in the coach drawn by the six black horses. Before leaving. the fairy godmother said, “Cinderella, this magic will only last until midnight! You must reach home by then!” . . .<br /><br />When Cinderella entered the palace, everybody was struck by her beauty. Nobody, not even Cinderella’s stepmother or stepsisters, knew who she really was in her pretty clothes and shoes. The handsome prince also saw her and fell in love with Cinderella. He went to her and asked, “Do you want to dance?” And Cinderella said, “Yes!” The prince danced with her all night and nobody recognized the beautiful dancer. Cinderella was so happy dancing with the prince that she almost forgot what the fairy godmother had said. At the last moment, Cinderella remembered her fairy godmother’s words and she rushed to go home. “Oh! I must go!” she cried and ran out of the palace. One of her glass slippers came off but Cinderella did not turn back for it. She reached home just as the clock struck twelve. Her coach turned back into a pumpkin, the horses into mice and her fine ball gown into rags. Her stepmother and stepsisters reached home shortly after that. They were talking about the beautiful lady who had been dancing with the prince. . .<br /><br />The prince had fallen in love with Cinderella and wanted to find out who the beautiful girl was, but he did not even know her name. He found the glass slipper that had come off Cinderella’s foot as she ran home. The prince said, “I will find her. The lady whose foot fits this slipper will be the one I marry!” The next day, the prince and his servants took the glass slipper and went to all the houses in the kingdom. They wanted to find the lady whose feet would fit in the slipper. All the women in the kingdom tried the slipper but it would not fit any of them. Cinderella’s stepsisters also tried on the little glass slipper. They tried to squeeze their feet and push hard into the slipper, but the servant was afraid the slipper would break. Cinderella’s stepmother would not let her try the slipper on, but the prince saw her and said, “Let her also try on the slipper!” The slipper fit her perfectly. The prince recognized her from the ball. He married Cinderella and together they lived happily ever after. . . <br /><br />

                        Cerita rakyat from West Kalimantan
<br />The Origin of Landak River
<br />Long time ago, lived a farmer and his wife in a village by the side of a forest. They lived simply and they like to help other people, especially one who in afflictions. One night, the farmer and his wife were resting in their house. The farmer was sitting beside his sleeping wife. Suddenly, a white centipede came out from the wife’s head. The farmer was amazed. He then followed the centipede until they reach a small pond not far from their house. Then the centipede suddenly disappeared. The farmer went home and found his wife still soundly asleep.
<br />In the morning, the wife told his husband about the dream she had last night. “I was walking through a vast field, and I came to a lake. I saw a giant hedgehog in the lake. It was glaring at me, so I ran away.” After he heard his wife’s dream, the farmer went back to the small pond. In the pond, he saw something very shiny. He came to the shiny object and took it. It was a golden hedgehog statue. It was very beautiful. Its eyes were made of diamond. The farmer then brought the statue home.
<br />At night, the farmer had a dream. A giant hedgehog came to him, “Please let me stay in your home. As return, I will give you everything you want. Just caress the statue’s head and say the prayer. There are two kinds of prayers, one is to start your wish and the second is to stop your wish. Now memorize the prayers.”
<br />In the next day, the farmer told his wife about his dream. They really wanted to prove it. The farmer slowly caressed the statue's head. He said the prayer and asked for rice. Suddenly, rice came out of the mouth of the statue. The rice kept on coming out from the statue's mouth. The farmer immediately said the prayer to stop it. The rice then stopped coming out from the statue.
<br />The farmer and his wife then asked for other things, jewelry and other stuff they needed. They became very rich. But they still like to help other people. A lot of poor came to them for help. Unfortunately, a thief found out about the secret of the golden hedgehog statue. Pretending to be a poor asking for help, he stole the statue from the farmer’s house.

The thief then caressed the hedgehog statue and said the prayer. Water came out of the statue’s mouth. All the people were so happy. But the water kept on coming out.

The thief also wanted to run away, but he cannot move his legs. In his vision, there was a giant hedgehog holding both his legs. Water kept coming from the statue and slowly it became a river.

                        Ir.Soekarno<br /><br />Actually he is not only a hero, but a great inspiration too. I choose him because I guess he is the great orator who was ever born in Indonesia. Many people were influenced by him until now. But not all people in the world know him, so I want to tell you a story about him.<br /><br />Born in Blitar, East Java, on Jun 10, 1901, He was named Kusno Sosrodihardjo but he was renamed Soekarno because he often got ill. There was a story when he was born. Soekarno was born in the morning , and there was a myth that the child who was born when the sun rises will be predicted to be a big figure on his time. Many people called him Son of the Sun. Stories about his childhood is known that he had a great attitude to communicate with other people.<br /><br />Growth as a talented boy, Soekarno continued his study to HBS in Surabaya. Then he went to Institute of Technology in Bandung (Bandung Institute of Technology) on Civil Department. He spent only 3 years to finish his study. He was not only a smart student but also active in Movement Party called PNI . He was arrested in 1929 by Dutch Colonial Authorities because of his activity in Indonesia Pro-Independence Movement. When he was released, he became a popular hero. He was arrested several times during the 1930’s and was put in jail when Japan occupied the archipelago in 1942.<br /><br />When Japan came to Indonesia, He was still active in Movement Party. On November 10, 1943 Soekarno became the leader of BPUPKI that was supported by Japan. Finally, on August 17, 1945 Indonesia declared the Independence day, and he became the first President of Indonesia.<br /><br />He passed away in 1970 and was buried in Blitar, East Java. Indonesian people were full of sadness. Although he had gone, his spirit is still alive and influences many people until now.<br /><br />Semoga membantu❤<br /><br /><p>My favourite national hero is Raden Adjeng Kartini. Because she was also a pioneer in the area of education for girls and women's rights for Indonesians. <br /><br />She was born into an aristocratic Javanese family when Java was part of the Dutch colony of the Dutch East Indies. She was born into a family with a strong intellectual tradition. <br /><br />Kartini's family allowed her to attend school until she was 12 years old. She learnt to speak Dutch, an unusual accomplishment for Javanese women at the time. <br /><br />Kartini continued to educate herself on her own. Because she could speak Dutch, she acquired several Dutch pen friends. One of them, a girl by the name of Rosa Abendanon, became a close friend. Books, newspapers and European magazines fed Kartini's interest in European feminist thinking, and fostered the desire to improve the conditions of indigenous Indonesian women, who at that time had a very low social status.<br /><br />Kartini's concerns were not only in the area of the emancipation of women, but also other problems of her society. Kartini saw that the struggle for women to obtain their freedom, autonomy and legal equality was just part of a wider movement.<br /><br />Her husband understood Kartini's aims and allowed her to establish a school for women in the east porch of the Rembang Regency Office complex. Kartini's only son was born on 13 September 1904. A few days later on 17 September 1904, Kartini died at the age of 25. She was buried in Bulu Village, Rembang.<br /><br />R.A. Kartini argue that not only was she a feminist who elevated the status of women in Indonesia, she was also a nationalist figure, with new ideas, who struggled on behalf of her people and played a role in the national struggle for independence.</p><br />

He was lonely. No one wanted to play with him, because they were afraid of his spike.<br />“Dear Landy. We don’t want to play with you because your spikes are too sharp. We don’t want you to hurts us,” said Cici the rabbit one day.<br />“Cici is right, Landy. It is not because you’re bad or rude to us, no, Landy. Just because of your spikes. They will stab us if we close to you,” said Tito the rooster.<br />Landy felt lonely. Landy spent most of the time day dreaming at the river bank, “I would be happy if there were no spikes on my body.”<br />Suddenly, Kuku the turtle appeared from the river. He came to Landy and said, “Landy, what are you thinking of?”<br />“Oh, nothing,” Landy replied.<br />“Don’t lie to me, Landy! Who knows I can help you,” said Kuku wisely. Then he sat beside Landy. He wasn’t afraid of Landy’s spikes.<br />Shortly, Landy told his problem. Kuku nodded his head. He said, “Poor you. But it isn’t your fault. I know, your spikes are very useful and helpful for you. They will realize it someday. Trust me!”<br />“Thanks, Kuku. You are my best friend.”<br />One day, Koko the frog held his birthday party. He invited all his friends, including Landy. But he decided not to come. He didn’t want to mess up the party.<br />“I’ll come with you Landy. I’ll tell everyone that you’re harmless,” said Kuku. Finally Landy attended the party. Everyone enjoyed it.<br />Suddenly Tito screamed, “Help….help.…! The evil wolf is coming. Save yourself!” Then, everyone saved their lives, except Kuku and landy. Kuku pulled his head and his leg into his shell. And Landy rolled his body into a ball.<br />Unintentionally, the evil wolf touched Landy. Of course, the spike pricked him. He screamed, “Ouch!” Since his foot was bleeding, he didn’t chase Landy’s friends any longer. Then, he ran away.<br />“Horray….horray….! Long live Landy! He saved our lives,” said Cici and her friends. They thanked him from then on. Landy wasn’t lonely anymore.<br /><br />Maaf kalau salah :)<br />

Then, she came up with a plan. “If you want to marry me, you have to build a thousand temples for me in just one night,” said Loro Jonggrang. “What? That’s impossible!” said Bandung Bondowoso. But he did not give up. He consulted with his advisor. “Your Majesty can asked the genies to help built the temples,” said the advisor.<br />So, Bandung Bondowoso summoned his entire genies soldier and commanded them to help him built a thousand temples. The genies worked in unbelievable speed. Meanwhile, Loro Jonggrang heard from her servant that the building of a thousand temples was almost finished. She was so worried. But again, she came up with a great idea. She asked all of her servants to help her. “Please prepare a lot of straw and mortar. Please hurry up!” said Loro Jonggrang. “Burn the straw and make some noise pounding the mortar, quickly.” All those servants did what Loro Jonggrang ordered them; burning straw and pounding the mortar, making the genies think that the sun is going to rise.<br />“It’s already dawn. We have to go,” said the leader of the genies to Bandung Bondowoso. All the genies immediately stopped their work and ran for cover from the sun, which they afraid of. They didn’t know that the light was from the fire that burning the straw, not from the sun.<br />Bandung Bondowoso can’t stop the genies from leaving. He was angry. He knew Loro Jonggrang had just tricked him. “You cannot fool me, Loro Jonggrang. I already have 999 temples. I just need one more temple. Now, I will make you the one-thousandth temple.” He pointed his finger to Loro Jonggrang and said some mantras. Magically, Loro Jonggrang’s body turned into stone.

Suddenly, she heard a little tap, tap, tap, at the door.<br /><br />"Who is that?" she said.<br /><br />"It's the Rain, and I want to come in," said a soft, sad, little voice.<br /><br />"No, you can't come in," the little Rosebud said. By and by she heard another little tap, tap, tap, on the window pane.<br /><br />"Who is there?" she said.<br /><br />The same soft little voice answered, "It's the Rain, and I want to come in!"<br /><br />"No, you can't come in," said the little Rosebud. Then it was very still for a long time. At last, there came a little rustling, whispering sound, all round the window:rustle, whisper, whisper.<br /><br />"Who is there?" said the little Rosebud.<br /><br />"It 's the Sunshine," said a little, soft, cheery voice, 'and I want to come in! "<br /><br />"N -- no," said the little pink rose, "you can't come in." And she sat still again.<br /><br />Pretty soon, she heard the sweet little rustling noise at the key-hole.<br /><br />"Who is there?" she said.<br /><br />"It 's the Sunshine," said the cheery little voice, "and I want to come in, I want to come in!"<br /><br />"No, no," said the little pink rose, "you cannot come in."<br /><br />By and by, as she sat so still, she heard tap, tap, tap, and rustle, whisper, rustle, all up and down the window pane, and on the door, and at the key-hole.<br /><br />"Who is there?" she said.<br /><br />"It's the Rain, and the Sun, the Rain and the Sun," said two little voices, together, "and we want to come in! We want to come in! We want to come in!"<br /><br />"Dear, dear," said the little Rosebud, "if there are two of you, I s'pose I shall have to let you in."<br /><br />So she opened the door a little wee crack, and they came in. And one took one of her little hands, and the other took her other little hand, and they ran, ran, ran with her, right up to the top of the ground. Then they said, --<br /><br />"Poke your head through!"<br /><br />So she poked her head through; and she was in the midst of a beautiful garden. It was springtime, and all the other flowers had their heads poked through; and she was the prettiest little pink rose in the whole garden!<br /><br /><br />
